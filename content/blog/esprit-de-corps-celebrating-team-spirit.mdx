The British Army borrows a French phrase, “Esprit de Corps,” to describe the deep pride, loyalty, and unity soldiers feel, not necessarily for country or ideology, but for the people standing beside them. In a similar spirit (though thankfully without the tanks and bayonets), the corporate world occasionally manages to foster this kind of camaraderie and loyalty among its teams.

My company, AMEX GBT, builds this through their annual recognition event called “Pacesetters.” Now, as a slightly cynical Brit, I’m naturally inclined to roll my eyes at corporate glitz, glamour, and overly sentimental narratives. Yet, I have to admit: this event was genuinely impressive, thoughtfully strategic, and, yes, even quite touching (well done Rakesh!).

This year, 480 employees, around 3% of our global workforce were honoured with an all-expenses-paid, four-day celebration in the sunshine and splendour of Miami Beach (thanks boss! 😎). Unlike typical sales-oriented recognition events I’d attended before, Pacesetters had a noticeably different vibe. In its 51st year, the focus was more on customer care, gratitude, and having a bloody good time! No workshops. No training sessions. Just lots of free time, parties, and pure appreciation.

AMEX GBT runs a classic platform business, connecting customers and suppliers through our world-class software and services, making events like Pacesetters possible through the deep partnerships and mutual appreciation we foster.

The generosity of our suppliers was _incredible_. American Airlines, Delta, and United each hosted unforgettable nights at clubs, complete with open bars, DJs, dancers, and live bands. We were put up in style at the Lowe’s Hotel, which delivered top-notch pool and beach parties, award shows, and a spectacular winner’s dinner. Wellness wasn’t forgotten either, I joined an unexpectedly brilliant yoga class to help shake off the party fatigue.

Then there were the prizes, supplied generously by partners: free flights, hotel stays, and jaw-dropping experiences. Highlights included unlimited business-class flights for a year courtesy of Qatar Airways, three staggering $50,000 travel credits from United, and a dream 15k holiday from Expedia. Presentations by Enterprise and Virgin Atlantic particularly stood out for being funny, engaging, and innovative.

After exploring the Everglades (and surviving the journey home), I’m genuinely humbled and deeply impressed. This event wasn’t a hollow corporate ritual; it felt authentic, meaningful, and filled with real human connection & new friends. True “Esprit de Corps”. Great Ideas Travel.
