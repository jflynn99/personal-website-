We live at an inflection point of history. Our era will be marked by a profound revolution – the rise of Artificial Intelligence. Yet many people do not yet realize the world has already changed. I am old enough to remember the world before the internet went mainstream. My first online experience was at an Internet café. After clubbing together with four friends to buy an expensive 30 minutes of surfing time, we ratcheted up the modem and trolled someone in a chat room – an early sign of things to come! Now it is difficult to imagine modern life without cheap, fast, and ubiquitous connection.

My children will not know life without AI. It will be far more powerful than the already game changing models we use now.

As with all revolutions, and I do think it will be a revolution, the road ahead will be bumpy. This transformation brings both excitement and uncertainty. While AI opens doors to unprecedented opportunities, it also poses challenges and ethical considerations, particularly in how we raise our children in this digital age. Will we have the greatest tutors a child could ask for, courtesy of AI? Or will we encounter a scenario where AI becomes a ‘second brain’ so powerful that it undermines the development of their own critical thinking skills? These are the questions we must ponder as we navigate this new terrain.

As will become clear I am an optimist, though there is a non zero chance of human extinction just to spice things up.

Ignoring the coming wave is not an option; the future is already here. This blog is a chronicle of my journey with AI, exploring its impact on fatherhood, my work in product management, and in everyday life.

Expect book and technology reviews, personal anecdotes, and insights into the rapidly evolving world of AI. I invite you to join the conversation, share your experiences, and explore the new world with me.
