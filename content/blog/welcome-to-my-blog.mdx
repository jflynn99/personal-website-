Welcome to my personal website! I'm excited to finally have a place to consolidate my thoughts, projects, and ideas.

## What I'll Write About

This blog will cover a variety of topics that interest me:

- **Product Management** - Lessons learned from building products, frameworks, and strategies
- **AI & Technology** - Exploring the latest developments in artificial intelligence and tech
- **Personal Projects** - Sharing what I'm building and learning along the way

## Why I Built This Site

I wanted a single place that combines:

1. My blog content (previously on WordPress)
2. My portfolio (previously on Lovable)
3. A home base for my online presence

This site is built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and MDX for content. The entire codebase is designed to be simple, fast, and easy to maintain.

## What's Next

I'll be migrating some of my favorite posts from my old blog and adding new content regularly. Stay tuned!
