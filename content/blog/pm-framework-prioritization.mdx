Every PM has been there: a backlog overflowing with "high priority" items, stakeholders pushing competing agendas, and a team looking to you for clarity on what matters most.

Here's the framework I use to cut through the noise.

## The ICE Score (Modified)

The classic ICE framework scores ideas on Impact, Confidence, and Ease. I've modified it slightly:

| Factor | Question | Scale |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Impact** | How much will this move our key metric? | 1-10 |
| **Confidence** | How sure are we about the impact estimate? | 1-10 |
| **Effort** | How many engineer-weeks? | Inverse (10/weeks) |

The formula: `(Impact × Confidence × Effort) / 100`

But here's the key insight: **don't trust the numbers blindly**. The value isn't in the final score—it's in the conversation the scoring process creates.

## The "Hell Yes" Filter

Before anything gets scored, it has to pass what I call the "hell yes" filter:

> If this ships perfectly and achieves everything we hope, will it meaningfully change our trajectory?

If the answer isn't an enthusiastic yes, it probably shouldn't be in your top 10. Harsh, but necessary.

## Stack Rank, Don't Bucket

Avoid the temptation to create priority buckets (P0, P1, P2). They inevitably inflate—everything becomes P1, and you're back to square one.

Instead, force a strict stack rank. Item #1 is more important than #2, which is more important than #3. No ties allowed.

This is uncomfortable. That's the point. It surfaces the hard trade-offs that buckets let you avoid.

## The Two-List System

I maintain two lists:

1. **The Committed List** (3-5 items): What we're definitely building this quarter
2. **The Considered List** (10-15 items): What we might build if things change

Everything else goes in the icebox. Not deleted—just explicitly not being considered right now.

## Revisit Weekly

Priorities aren't set-and-forget. Every week, I ask:

- Did we learn anything that changes our confidence scores?
- Did the competitive landscape shift?
- Are we on track with the committed list?

Adjust the stack rank accordingly. Small, frequent adjustments beat quarterly priority overhauls.

## The Hard Truth

No framework eliminates the discomfort of saying "no" to good ideas. That's not a bug—it's the job. The framework just helps you say no for the right reasons.

What prioritization methods work for you? I'm always looking to refine my approach.
