## Overview

This is my personal website that consolidates my blog and portfolio into a single, cohesive platform. Built with modern web technologies for optimal performance and developer experience.

## Features

- **MDX-powered blog** with tag filtering and reading time estimation
- **Project showcase** with detailed write-ups for featured projects
- **Dark mode only** design with a clean, minimal aesthetic
- **SEO optimized** with Open Graph tags, Twitter cards, and RSS feed
- **Fully responsive** layout that works on all devices

## Technical Highlights

### Content Management

All content is managed through MDX files, making it easy to write posts with embedded React components when needed. Gray-matter handles frontmatter parsing for metadata.

### Performance

The site is statically generated at build time for optimal performance. Images are optimized using Next.js Image component with lazy loading.

### Design System

Uses CSS custom properties for consistent theming. The amber accent color (#f59e0b) provides visual interest against the dark background (#0f0f0f).

## Lessons Learned

Building this site reinforced the value of simplicity. Starting with a minimal feature set allowed me to ship faster and iterate based on actual needs rather than hypothetical requirements.
