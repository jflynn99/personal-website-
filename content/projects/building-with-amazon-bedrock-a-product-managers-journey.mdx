I recently completed Lee Assam’s _course [Learning Amazon Bedrock](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-amazon-bedrock-23090599)_, and it was a real eye-opener for me as a product manager. Amazon Bedrock is a service from AWS that allows users to integrate and scale generative AI with ease. Think of it as the tooling and infrastructure that lets you plug in a wide range of powerful Gen AI models without the need for complex development processes. It’s like being handed the keys to the kitchen with a message to “bake something fun.” 

Having fun here does require some developer skills – something I don’t _quite_ have on my own. However, the world has changed, and now I have a brilliant co-intelligence to help me where I struggle: ChatGPT.

After successfully setting up my AWS account and user profiles – a notably smooth onboarding process – I struggled to activate the models. It took several days and running an ICS instance to “wake” everything up. Bedrock offers access to many foundational models from top providers such as Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, StabilityAI, as well as their native options, Titan and Nova. Naturally, they don’t have Google’s Gemini or OpenAI’s ChatGPT on demand – though services like Hugging Face can help access these via AWS.

## APIs All the Way Down

One thing that stood out to me is how Bedrock makes it simple to access foundation models via an API. The course is specifically for developers but is simple and well explained, most steps are easy to follow. However, since its launch, several code libraries, formatting rules, and webpage URLs have changed. A developer could have solved these issues independently but for me simply copying the code didn’t work. ChatGPT proved invaluable in debugging. It guided me step-by-step through each error, helping resolve issues efficiently and making the process much smoother.

We called the Bedrock API by running Python code from a GitHub Codespace. With fewer than 100 lines of simple (ChatGPT-edited) code, I was talking to Claude via Bedrock’s API. A magic moment.

There’s no complex setup or heavy-handed dependencies – just a clean, intuitive way to build connections to generative AI. You can easily mix and match models based on what works best for your use case. Need conversational AI? Claude Sonnet or Mistral have you covered. Require enterprise-grade translations? Cohere pour toi. Need images? StabilityAI delivers. Are costs important? Claude Haiku might be your best bet. Bedrock keeps your options open.

From a business perspective, whether your use case involves handling customer queries, summarising documents, or generating creative content, you can rely on Bedrock’s versatility to adapt to your needs.

## Show Me don’t Tell Me

As a PM, I’m always looking at how tools can empower teams to deliver better products faster. What struck me about Bedrock is how it streamlines this process. It’s not just about getting a model up and running – it’s about making sure it’s production ready without needing a team of machine learning experts at your beck and call. That kind of accessibility is a game-changer.

Speaking of empowering tools, integrating these models with Streamlit for the UI was the icing on the cake. Streamlit makes it remarkably simple (and free!) to create clean, interactive front ends that look like you spent hours building them. In reality, it too was fewer than 100 lines of simple Python code. The tool’s drag-and-drop widgets and dynamic updates let you iterate quickly and focus on building an interface that resonates with users. For someone like me, who isn’t a front-end expert, it feels like unlocking a whole new world of possibilities.

## One More Step: RAG

So far, we’ve built a nice UI that calls a foundational model via an API. Technically impressive, but not super useful without context.

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system combines generative AI models with a retrieval mechanism that pulls relevant, real-time information from a predefined dataset or database. This ensures that responses are contextual and grounded in reliable data. It forces the model to “check the recipe” rather than just baking an answer from its existing knowledge.

For example, we added a PDF “Social Media Policy” document, and you could see the responses were grounded in the document while still being generated by Claude in direct response to the query.

Yes I made my bot call me “Boss”. I need that kebab shop validation.

While functional, this application isn’t a final product. It lacks guardrails; for example, you can easily get it off-topic by asking about dinosaurs

## Takeaways

By the end of this course, I had launched a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhanced chatbot with a slick UI that genuinely works. It’s more than just a prototype; it’s something you could show to stakeholders or even deploy for real users. The app’s ability to provide accurate, context-aware responses in a polished, user-friendly interface makes it a valuable tool for showcasing or addressing user needs.

So what does this all mean? For me, it’s been a reminder of how accessible cutting-edge technology has become. As product managers, we’re no longer bound by the limits of what our engineering teams can build from scratch. We’re stepping into an era where tools lower the barriers to innovation, letting us focus on solving real user problems. It’s amazing and empowering to know that I can take an idea, spin up a fully functional AI-driven app, and deliver value—all without needing a PhD in machine learning or even a 101 in Python.

The tech landscape is evolving at lightning speed, and tools like these remind us that the gap between idea and execution is shrinking. It’s never been easier to build. In the short to medium term, AI-enhanced people are entering a golden period. In the longer term, however, I wonder how long they’ll stay in the loop.
