Engrossing crime caper. My third Dom Winslow and I'm still having a good time, unlike the protagonist here. <br/><br/>This is set in 80s New England and focuses on an "Irish" vs "Italian" gang war. Gritty, well written and action packed. A little stereotyped of course, but feels authentic. <br/><br/>I would say I have detected a tell his books, there always seems to be a totally unrealistic female character, often in a hooker or hooker adjacent role. As before it has little extra to give to the story - she could have been mundane and it would have fitted the story better. Maybe it hits in book 2, one I've already ordered as good easy listening.
