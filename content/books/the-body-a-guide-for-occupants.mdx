Free flowing, thought provoking, poignant, and funny just like his other books. Self recommending to fans, and to anyone with an interest in our bodies!<br/><br/>We have chapters dedicated to parts of the body jam packed with facts, history, great lines, and interesting stories.<br/><br/> - We have a meter of DNA in each cell, enough to reach beyond Pluto if placed end to end, we are literally cosmic in size. <br/> - One unfortunate woman had an Itchy head, unable to satisfy the itch she scratched through to her brain!<br/> - We have capacity to store 2000 terabytes of information in a grain of sands worth of brain! <br/> - "Brainstem death is<br/>the fundamental measure of deadness in the UK "<br/><br/>There are sad moments too, overlooked scientists, the ravages of deseise at personal and societal levels, death in general. The only complaint is that you are often left wanting more, as with any overview we only go skin deep on each subject.
