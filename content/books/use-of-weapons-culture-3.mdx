For me this was a confusing foray into the Culture universe. And not only for the original sequencing device of one story and chapter told forwards with one backwards, alternatively.<br/><br/>There is a big payoff right at the end, but it's a bit of a slog to get there. I was quite bored for the first half of the story, there are scenes that make no sense at first, and extensive hide and seek sections. Then there's a Brewster's millions chapter or two. <br/><br/>The technology levels of the planets visited is also confusing - very much like WW2 with tanks, planes and battleships yet also a multi-planet space faring civilization? <br/><br/>Felt like it was relying on the literary device as opposed to world building. <br/><br/>I have read in published order, and have rated 5* 4* and 3* here. It will need to pick up if I am to make it to book 9!
