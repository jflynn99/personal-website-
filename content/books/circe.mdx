"All that smoke and savour rising so delicately from our altars. It leaves only ash behind".<br/><br/>Fantastic in both senses of the word. A really punchy and action packed modern retelling of some of the most famous Greek myths. <br/><br/>The titular Circe really comes alive, and despite her divine nature time and time again shows her humanity - from her touching motherly goodness to the rasping vengeance. <br/><br/>Follows the general outline of the classic Greek myths, so expect tragedy, some famous names dropping by, things not being all they seem, and unforeseen self torment. At times brutal, and at times blasé about it! <br/><br/>Great fun, some good life lessons too, I may at be careful when I turn people into monsters...
