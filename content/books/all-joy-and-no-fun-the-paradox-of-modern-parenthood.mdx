Enjoyable and informative book reflecting on how parents are changed by parenthood. It is well written and researched, offering a fresh perspective in a crowded section of the bookshop. <br/><br/>It follows the stages of parenthood with interesting historical context combined with modern science and research. This is all hooked together with the author's own personal research with real people - this is where we build an emotional link with the people and book. This really builds to a quite beautiful and poingant ending. <br/><br/>Delivers facts, truths, worries, and wisdom. With sadness, joy, and solace for food measure. <br/><br/>My only negative marks are a possible over reliance on some sources and a large American slant. <br/><br/>Recommended for parents.
