Wow wow wow. Best sci-fi book I've ever read, maybe best fiction book too. Absolutely off the wall. <br/>Mysterious, weird, varied, smart and very funny.<br/>The familiar structure of several, seemingly independent, back stories told by the participants of a pilgrimage aids a stunning universe-building epic. Several of the stories would independently qualify as short form classics.<br/>Great 'science' giving us mind bending time problems, alt-humans, awesome future tech, and even new drugs.<br/>Fabulous writing, deep and complex characters. Touching. <br/>Super interesting history. As vividly brilliant during a visit to the battle of Agincourt as to future space battles. <br/>Philosophical and wise on religion, war, humanity, technology, AI, environmental destruction, poetry and politics. <br/>Exciting and pulsating moments of tension and action. All of that without even mentioning THE SHRIKE!!!
