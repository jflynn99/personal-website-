Both of the authors previous books are in my all time top 5, this work does not quite hit those heights but still displays Harari's singular perspective and cutting edge. Especially the latter chapters. I say work rather than book as this really feels like the collection of essays it is as opposed to a detailed and in depth discussion like Sapiens and Homo Deus. Remains outstanding, great as a taster for people who have not read Sapiens (why not??) Or for devotees looking for wise musings on the gig topics of today.
