Definitive and exaustive history of the famous NAZI war crimes trail following the end of WW2. <br/><br/>Beautifully written, containing detailed descriptive information and cool analysis - with a few wry jokes thrown in to boot! <br/><br/>It is very much a history of the trial itself, not the crimes that led to it. I am sure it is mandatory reading for international law students, but maybe not so essential for the lay reader, and I am a major WW2 nerd. It gets granular, with the legal careers of the judges and the parties the staff went too all covered, as well as the boredom of large parts of the proceedings - that comes across all too clearly. <br/><br/>Great on the philosophical underpinnings and international constraints of the very concept, and on how this led to the post war (especially post cold war) international criminal justice systems.
