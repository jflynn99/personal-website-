Again I find myself in Nazi Germany. What a surprise. This time because I resurrected my old Kindle and couldn’t remember how to get back to the main screen after pressing on a book - i did not know that it was another NAZI book in my defence. But, once I’d started, the only way out was through.<br/><br/>Pretty good overall. The child’s view of war and the Nazi years is handled really well, the characters feel alive, and there are brave moments, such as the fate of the girl's families. The ending felt a bit too “nice” for such a grim setting, but as a story it worked. Great for YA, glad I stuck with it.
