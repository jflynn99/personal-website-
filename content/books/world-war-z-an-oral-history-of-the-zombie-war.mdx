Fantastic, absorbing read, most unlike the poor film adaptation. Dark, funny, and inventive, you really feel the anguish and horror if the survivors. Told in almost stand alone chapters, you get a global and multi level examination of total disaster. Some of the chapters are truly five star, some fall a but short. Great world building (destroying too!).
