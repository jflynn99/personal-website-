Breathtaking conclusion to the story we have so far. That's some decade + cliffhangers George ! hahaha.<br/><br/>Immense, I feel one if the biggest effects of the series on me is the absolute evisceration of the statement "it's can't get any worse" oh my, it can. Lots of canabalism, with more to come! <br/><br/>Outstanding horror writing on display - the Winterfell scenes in particular are amazing. <br/><br/>Shame both pending battles didn't make the cut, really would have liked at least one of them included.
