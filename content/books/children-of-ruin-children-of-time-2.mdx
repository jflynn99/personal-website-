We're Going on an Adventure!<br/><br/>Excellent continuation of the series. I was worried where exactly the sequel would take us, but it is both imaginative - with a new species thrown into the genetically enhanced mix, and distinctive enough from the first with a terrifying horror element thrown in. <br/><br/>These sections, with their slow build up, puzzling clues and horrific outcomes are the best parts of the book (if a little reminiscent of the protomolecule for Expanse readers).<br/><br/>The new species, Octopus, makes a fine choice. Their weird and spectacular minds explored in a scientific and fun way - I have read "Other Minds" by Perter Godfrey-Smith on cephalopod evolution and consciousness - they pair together brilliantly. (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2308405481?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1)<br/><br/>The story starts a little slow then later explodes into near constant action, we have the same large time jumps as in the first book, dealt with through flashbacks, and direct links to the original too, its a sequel not a standalone. <br/><br/>Some of the philosophical and scientific explorations are truly first rate, AI, consciousness, theory of language, theory of mind - good to read up on Wittgenstien!<br/><br/>It is also very funny at times, some laugh out load moments involving the AI who is ran on ant computers, and 'floating voters' in the octopus society. <br/><br/>Once again, I am a little worried where we are going in round three, the end was very similar to the first, with another raising of the stakes and more new crewmembers on the inter-species explorer ships. Further and further away from humanity we sail, but I'm hitched on-board!<br/><br/>
