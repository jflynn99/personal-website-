Clear and consice baby info.<br/><br/>A book by an economist that breezily follows her story from conception to birth stopping off for science, economics, and evidence along the way. <br/><br/>Lots about numbers here as you may expect - I have an analytical mind and they are what I was looking for. Generally very reassuring. Sometimes surprising, sometimes shocking. <br/><br/>The data on alcohol in particular struck me. As did several dated procedures that have virtually zero reliable modern evidence.<br/><br/>I would only add (at this very early point for me!) That the info on caffeine may be a little dated, indeed the risk of miscarriage may be minimal or non-existent, but there may be effects on the baby's sleep - this was not discussed. See Why we Sleep by Matthew Walker. <br/><br/>Very informative, and UK version at least has a lot of NHS data to go with the US stuff (the author is American).
