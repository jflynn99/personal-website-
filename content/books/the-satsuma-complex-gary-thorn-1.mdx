Very funny local mystery with our hero Gary, the deadpan, gentle “shithouse” paralegal - I later learned that in another life he could be Bob Mortimer himself.<br/><br/>The opening felt a bit simple and odd, but once the second point of view comes in, the writing clicks - suddenly vivid and effortless. The character work is spot-on, and Mortimer’s voice in the audio version shines through.<br/><br/>Not strictly a comedy, but there are laugh-out-loud moments that are some of the funniest scenes I’ve ever read. The mechanic scene (tea, then nettles) is genius, and the police interview line “no comment, other than to say there’s a cat at home desperate for a shit” had me in bits. Some great decriptive prose too ""he smelled like a supermodels handbag".<br/><br/>Tense, intriguing, silly, and surprisingly sharp. Recommended.
