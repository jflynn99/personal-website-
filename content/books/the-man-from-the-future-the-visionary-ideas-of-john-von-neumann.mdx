The Man from the Future by John von Neumann<br/><br/>John von Neumann, considered by some to be the smartest man of all time, certainly lives up to the title of the biography. A pioneer across multiple fields, von Neumann made ground-breaking contributions to areas ranging from pure mathematics to nuclear weapons, digital computing, and even economics. In many ways we live in a future he envisioned. Has anyone else had a greater individual impact on modernity? His achievements certainly outweigh his fame. <br/><br/>Von Neumann’s intellect was vast, spanning disciplines outside of his mathematical homebase with ease. He made seminal contributions to pure mathematics (notably game theory), nuclear weapon design, the architecture and programming of the first digital computers, and artificial life. <br/><br/>His work continues to shape our world: 99% of the world’s computers use von Neumann architecture. Remarkably, von Neumann independently arrived at the same conclusion as his friend, Kurt Gödel, regarding his famous incompleteness theorem, quietly setting aside his work upon discovering he was second. He met and worked with the other great computer scientist of the era, Alan Turing, with it being suggested they each held half of the puzzle in their heads. Their wartime collaborations remain shrouded in mystery.<br/><br/>There are dozens of Nobel prizes and Field’s medals stories that pick up just where von Neumann left off - constantly busy with other work and interests he does not have some of the public acclaim such (overblown) prizes confer. <br/><br/>The biography tells his story a particular way, with thematic chapters focusing on one aspect of his work and somewhat ignoring the timeline. Told like this the eras overlap and work that was clearly linked seems distinct. For example his ground-breaking work in computer design and programming was explicitly to carry out H-bomb calculations; but this is separated into nuclear weapons and computing chapters. With such focus on the work, we don’t get the deepest look at the man himself. <br/><br/>We do learn of his comfortable childhood. By the age of six he could converse in ancient Greek and multiply two eight digit numbers in his head - it is said his father remained superior at this game. This comfortable life in a recently ennobled Jewish family at the apex of the Austro-Hungarian empire would be shattered by war, revolution, and racism. <br/><br/>It’s somewhat ironic that von Neumann’s father worried about the practical applications of his son’s mathematical talents and pushed him toward a more "useful" chemical engineering degree - passed in addition to his mathematics PhD. He would study in Germany until moving to Princeton in the early 1930s, a personification of the shifting centre for scientific and mathematical progress from central Europe to America. <br/><br/>We do learn that von Neumann’s personal life was as dynamic as his professional one. Known for his all-night soirees, a taste for hard liquor, fast cars, and smoking, he was no reclusive savant but rather the life and soul of the party.<br/><br/>It's a poignant reminder of the times that so much of von Neumann’s genius was dedicated to weapons development. He was an expert on ballistics for the US Army long before joining the Manhattan Project. Having witnessed the horrors of totalitarianism in Hungary, von Neumann strongly urged his friends (especially the Jews) to leave Europe while there was still time. It’s debatable whether it’s tragic that such brilliance was devoted to war, or fortunate that it was on the right side.<br/><br/>After World War II, von Neumann became deeply involved with the RAND Corporation, where his interests in computers, game theory, and nuclear strategy found a perfect home. He had developed game theory back in Europe, and his insights later extended far beyond games to the grim arena of thermonuclear annihilation. His work in this field outstripped even that of Nobel laureate John Nash, recognizing that humans are not purely rational agents and often cooperate. His contributions to economics with the eccentric Oskar Morgenstern, laid the foundation for modern decision theory and behavioural economics— Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman called utility theory “the most important social scientific theory ever”.<br/><br/>During this time, von Neumann also advocated for pre-emptive nuclear war against the Soviet Union, a view shared by others, including the pacifist Bertrand Russell. While hindsight allows us to see this stance as horrific, it reflects the pervasive fear of the era. By 1954, von Neumann had changed his mind; the cost, measured in hundreds of millions dead, was now too high. His influence on nuclear doctrine would be immortalized in Stanley Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove, whose titular character was partly based on him.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most relevant parts of the book for today's readers concern von Neumann's vision of computers and artificial intelligence. He foresaw the need for vast computational power and predicted that computers would become ubiquitous, integrated into everyday life—not merely rare, hyper-specialized machines. He coined the term “the singularity” and viewed the rise of artificial intelligence with more apprehension than the nuclear weapons he helped create. Yet, he believed it was a moral duty for scientists to pursue what was feasible, even if the consequences were uncertain and risky. A path most of today’s AI scientists follow.  <br/><br/>Von Neumann's role in the development of the first electronic computer, the ENIAC, was pivotal—using it to run H-bomb calculations without his colleagues' full awareness. Tragically, espionage by fellow Los Alamos scientist Klaus Fuchs around this project helped mistakenly convince the Soviets that the Americans were actively developing a H-bomb, initiating their own program.<br/><br/>The book also highlights von Neumann's second wife, Klara, who has a valid claim to being the first computer programmer having run the first modern code. This work, done months before work done by a team in Manchester was also significantly more complex. The couple also pioneered Monte Carlo randomization methods after Stanislaw Ulam brought the idea to von Neumann at Los Alamos. These are essential to modern machine learning, and exemplifies how von Neumann’s influence permeates even today’s cutting-edge technologies. The book also romantically suggests that it is named after where the lovers met, though a gambling uncle of Stanislaw takes the credit on Wikipedia. <br/><br/>Chasing increased compute (sound familiar?) von Neumann’s contributions to computing included the creation of the MANIAC, the fastest computer of its time, but his work on basic design would prove more influential. Labelled as the cornerstone of modernity, the “birth certificate of modern computers, the most influential work of all time” the simplified architecture that bears his name was not all his own work, but his report detailing it is widely recognized as seminal and original; despite the failed efforts of others involved to sue him for giving away a million dollar idea for nothing. <br/><br/>On this point our hero seems to be a big fan of what we would call “open source”. He thought it essential that the fundamentals of science and computing were shared widely, not commoditized and hidden for profit. This idealistic vision is to be applauded and has echoed down the decades to the great benefit of humanity. The debate continues today, highlighted in the current AI explosion, should such advances be in the hands of private individuals, companies, or nations? Is it sustainable for the basics like Transformer technology to be openly shared but individual models hidden and commoditized? Does this hold true at AGI levels?<br/><br/>Towards the end of his life he would be enchanted by replicators and artificial life. This biography suggests it may be his most original and insightful work—remarkably produced in his 50s, long after most mathematicians peak. His Universal Constructor concept, written out in pure logic and predating the discovery of DNA, laid the groundwork for understanding self-replication and evolution through small changes. His programs, possibly the first computer virus, would only be ran decades later once computer power increased.  <br/><br/>Just before his death from cancer, his essay “Can we survive technology” was published. In it he warns about the danger of rapidly advancing technology in a finite world. With technology having truly global impacts he doubted our ability to understand it and restrain ourselves. He presciently identified issues such as climate change and the greenhouse effect, as well as the potential and risks of geoengineering. He describes a variant of “Moore’s Law” decades before Moore. <br/><br/>The essay identifies many of the risks and issues humanity has struggled with since his death, ones that will only grow in importance in the near future (looking at you AI). He, like I, was hopeful but unconvinced we would pull through as we have done so before. He was convinced that we cannot stop the march of ideas "for progress there is no cure". The only possible safety is relative; “there is no panacea to avoid extinction at the hands of technology, only the human qualities: patience, flexibility, intelligence.”
