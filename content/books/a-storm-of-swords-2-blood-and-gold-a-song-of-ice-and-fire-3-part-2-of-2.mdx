Everytime I think I have found a comparable series my return to Westeros obliterates the notion. <br/><br/>Even though I know almost exactly what will happen I remain in shock and awe. All the big cards are dealt here, I mean the series could have ended with a few minor tweaks, and it would have been a masterpiece. <br/><br/>Generally considered the best book so far I find no grounds to argue with that, I just hope there's enough left to top it. That will be some achievement.<br/><br/>The divergence of the TV show to its own arcs becomes more pronounced at this point so we can be confident it will be better that that, exciting! I just need the self control to take the remaining books slowly!
