"What matters is that the story is passed on"<br/><br/>An epic piece of fiction. We have an intricately constructed story, where a story itself is the vessel that passes through the tulmut of thousands of years of history to link our disparate protagonists together. It's an ambitious idea brilliantly engineered. <br/>I have not read the highly rated book "Cloud Atlas" though I have watched the movie, it seems similar in this regard. <br/><br/>The writing is first rate. Much like his particularly excellent and widely celebrated previous book "All the light we cannot see". You feel as if you are there in the death throws of Constantinople, a Bulgarian mountain village in winter, a filthy POW camp in Korea, the (even more) desolate Australian outback in the near future, or on a starship. There's more sci-fi in this book, a wider cast, yet I could relate to the the characters in a meaningful way. <br/><br/>My only minor issue is with a small detail at the very end... I mean, she did not seem to walk very far!... :)<br/><br/>It's a wonderful way to spend your reading time. This story is worthy of being passed on for no other reason than that.
