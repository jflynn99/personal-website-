The penultimate book and it's a cracker. <br/><br/>We have some long awaited answers to the main mystery, and some epic deaths amongst a tale of empire vs resistance that is shaded in grey as opposed to Star Wars style black and white. <br/><br/>Tension is high, both cosmically and between allies - lots of discussion on what is best, negotiation or violent action, with context being key. <br/><br/>The final book promises even more!
