A first rate history of last year.<br/><br/>I've never read history so close to the time before, yet this feels essential. Never before have a couple of years felt like so much more! <br/><br/>This is my first book (won't be the last!) by the author though I have followed his writing for years. The introduction and conclusion feel like the better newsletters or articles - immense in scope yet surgical in getting to the core issues. Truly global with dense and intracite specialist knowledge in specific hard to understand topics. <br/><br/>The chapters feel much more like standard history chapters, detailed, well researched and sticking within the outlines provided. <br/><br/>Overall there is a pulsating narrative, outstanding writing, moments of great levity and the raising of the most important questions for the future of us all. <br/><br/>Maybe the strongest point I absorbed was the immense failure to provide the funding to vaccinate the world - a task costing just billions when the world marshalled trillions in response to the economic crisis, it is clear to everyone that it pays for itself many times over - in days. Yet it is not done. The money to do it can be borrowed at negative interest rates by any major economy. Yet it is not done. <br/><br/>Bioshocks (and other shocks) will come again, they will be worse, will we be any better?<br/><br/>Highly recommended.
