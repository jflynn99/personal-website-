I listened to the Stephen Fry narration - what a rollicking adventure. Only afterwards did I learn it was originally a radio play, which makes perfect sense.<br/><br/>It’s incredibly funny and incredibly British. I knew half the jokes already just from cultural osmosis, despite never reading the book or watching the film before. Some of the one-liners still got me (“best bang since the big one”), and the weird set-pieces like the whale’s inner monologue as it plummets towards the planet - had me properly laughing. Dolphins and hamsters(!)… still not sure what to say there ahaha.<br/><br/>What surprised me is how much it still resonates. The computer “Deep Thought” and the philosophers terrified of being put out of a job feel straight out of the current AI/LLM debates. Even Google cribbed its name from “Googleplex.” Adams was way ahead of his time.<br/><br/>Very funny, very weird, and now I get why it’s such a global touchstone.
