A well written and always interesting look at how we can improve performance. As a surgeon, the examples the writer takes are all from the medical world but are generally applicable elsewhere. <br/><br/>Rather than looking at medical or technical breakthroughs, he looks at three areas where we can all improve with some startling and touching examples. Diligence, ingenuity, and what it takes to do right are the three sections. <br/><br/>Seemingly mundane topics like hand washing are vividly rendered as essential. The successful and importantly, unsuccessful, methods used today are highlighted with the wider lessons useful for everyone.<br/><br/>Some sections seem slightly out of place, the medical assistance in death penalty cases section is good, the most philosophical section of the book, but does not seem to fit so well with the rest.<br/><br/>The book is quite US focused so expect lots of insurance industry talk, some of it slightly dated. It is well put, though not super important to a Brit. The sections in India are among the best. <br/><br/>There is a particularly great part on medicine as a craft, versus an industry. How the best results in a specific situations may not yeild the best chances overall. The example centers on the use of forceps compared to Cesarean section. While better results are demonstrated with skilled use of forceps, the standardized, easily taught operation can be done with much less training giving it far greater reach, especially in remote areas. The author rightly laments the seemingly inevitable loss of a skilled craft.<br/><br/>The ending tips are very medically focused and are not for everyone, the book though is - it was my first by his m and I intend to read more.
