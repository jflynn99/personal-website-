Good end to the series, though I'm surprised there is not another as the narrative ends with some way to go in the story of Kublai Khan. <br/><br/>You will know by now that there is plenty of fiction in this historical fiction, but it's a great story with good fully developed characters (except the comically bad brother). Action packed, suspenseful and at times very thoughtful.
