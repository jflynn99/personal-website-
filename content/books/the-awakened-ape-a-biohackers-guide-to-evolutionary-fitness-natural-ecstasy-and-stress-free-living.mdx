A very generous 2* at that. A lot of this is trash in both style and content, made worse by the sense that the author knows better - at least for the content parts. Fast an loose with science, reason, argumentation, anthropology, and evidence, despite knowing better. <br/><br/>Some of the writing, especially the stories of his sexual conquests, is repulsive, condescending, and gross. I feel it is not a book women will enjoy. I could see male teenage virgins enjoying it though, and I actually think much of the content would benefit that demographic too.<br/><br/>On a good note there is wisdom and knowledge here, it is just better found elsewhere. Almost anywhere elsewhere. A quick synopsis would be live a 'paleo lifestyle' (get back to nature, eat right, exercise, build meaningful realtionships) and meditate a lot.<br/><br/>Solid advice, poorly communicated!
