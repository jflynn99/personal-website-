Tour 'da' Force<br/><br/>An immense modern crime novel. It blew me away; smart, dark, gritty, literary. <br/><br/>It's not only my first Dom Winslow, it's my first crime fiction - surprising given my love of the real life criminal underworld both past and present. <br/><br/>This is a twisting, complex story of corruption framed through our (mostly) good, yet dirty cop lead.<br/><br/>What really makes it stand out are wonderfully threaded themes of racism, money, power, violence, justice and New York itself. <br/><br/>It reminds me of The Wire. Maybe crossed with Requiem for a Dream. It's real, bleak, but there are several laugh out loud moments. <br/><br/>The supporting characters are well fleshed out, believable, you feel for them. And be prepared, they go through a lot. <br/><br/>I loved this book, though if I were being critical it maybe pushes crudelity a little to far at the very end. A minor quibble. <br/><br/>Wonderfully written. Will make a great TV series. I will be back no doubt.
