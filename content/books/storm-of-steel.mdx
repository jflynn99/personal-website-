Carnival of Carnage <br/><br/>Tough to review - I expected a huge amount from this book based on the excerpts I had heard of in books or on podcasts like Hardcore History. It did not dissapoint, but it did not blow me away - pun not intended. <br/><br/>The work is visceral, real and gritty. Published in 1920 it feels close to the action not the longer term consequences. The memoir of a lower ranking (insanely?) brave young officer who is swept up by his world view, think duty, glory, chivalry, honour, patriotism. He's idealistic but not blind or stupid, he knows what's coming and in no way shies away from the coming storm. <br/><br/>What's atypical is that he is not availed of these feelings despite the absolute horror he continually faces. It is not going to far to suggest Junger enjoyed it. He appreciated the war for sure. For both philosophical and excitement reasons. <br/><br/>"life has no meaning except when pledged for an ideal, no other generation has been so favoured"<br/><br/>Even the outcome of the war does not change his mind - "the fallen did not die for nothing, for resolve" it was worth it - a way of proving their mettle. <br/><br/>You can indeed read a lot of Niczhean uberman into his worldview, immense strength of character, ideals persevering through the toughest tests, personality coming through apparently intact despite 14 serious wounds. <br/><br/>Maybe I wanted him to see the folly of his ways, maybe I wanted comment on the stupidity and waste of war, maybe that's why I liked "All quiet on the Western front" so much - maybe that's an issue my side. The book really is focused on the fighting, 1914-18 without wider comment, from someone who was there, as an example of that it is unsurpassed. <br/><br/>The writing/translation is genuinly spectacular too.
