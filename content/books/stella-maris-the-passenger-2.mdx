A decent companion novella to "The Passenger" though I doubt it would really work as an independent book.<br/><br/>We have a set of dialogs between a psychiatrist and Alicia (nee Alice) Western, Bobby's sister, his center, and stage for the 'horts' from the first book. <br/><br/>This setting allows for almost no plot, rather it adds depth (pun intended) and colour to "The Passenger". To the extent that it seems to me likely they were originally part of the same book. It may work better this way, it is different in tone. <br/><br/>I was satisfied to some extent on some open questions from "The Passenger". I feel her viewpoint provides some answers, leaves others within grasp, though some remain compleatly unknowable. <br/><br/>As with Bobby and the history of physics tangents, Alicia hits us with the same force in the areana of mathematics. It's going to be over most people's heads, mine included. McCarthy has spent years researching this, it does feel like he needed outlets for it to pour out if him before he passes. I am unsure if it matters to either story. <br/><br/>That said some of the tangents and thoughts are facinsting. Again he slips in a lot from his outstanding essay 'the Kerkule problem'. https://nautil.us/the-kekul-problem-236574/<br/><br/>For example Alicia positing language as a parasite - with the (millions of years older) unconscious being totally unready for it, struggling to adapt to such a powerful force that evolved from no know need. And apparently bringing with it endless war (reminiscent if the Judge from Blood Meridian), and madness itself - there can't be madness without language, as how would the voices in your head talk to you?? Haha.<br/><br/>Should be read by all those that read "The Passenger" though they should not expect answers to all the questions posed there, and maybe not by so many others...
