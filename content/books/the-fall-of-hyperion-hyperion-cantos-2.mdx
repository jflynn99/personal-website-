Outstanding continuation of my favourite sci-fi series so far. Worrying yet impressiy how a book 30 years old seems so very prescient today.<br/><br/>Fantastic imagination especially for the tech, AI, and religious aspects. For a sci-fi book I learned a lot about a Victorian poet! <br/><br/>A damning yet realistic view of politics, with powerful environmental overtones and, I venture, a spiritual message about human development and exploration that is reminiscent of the great Carl Sagan. <br/><br/>Some brilliant writing again, the passage containing the "ultimate Dachau of the soul" will certainly stay with me! <br/><br/>A gripping narrative replaces the story within a story structure of the first book, and we play in the universe as opposed to build it - both fantastic fun even if you feel that it is a little easier from a literary perspective. <br/><br/>Similarly, by the end of the book (and via several hairpin twists) we are solving the mysteries as opposed to creating them, I really enjoyed the outcomes, I could see why not everyone would.
