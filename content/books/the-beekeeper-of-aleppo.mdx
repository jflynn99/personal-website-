A beautifully crafted and genuinely touching story based around one families tragedy and their subsequent joining of one of the great human migrations. <br/><br/>It is a vivid portrait of the psychological and physical turmoil caused by war and the migrant trail to Europe. <br/><br/>Consistently brutal, the book is sprinkled with wonderful writing. I really enjoyed the bee motif.<br/><br/>The book is wonderfully structured, with a dual timeline filling out the story via flashbacks. The tension rises as the catastrophes unfold - even if you know where they end up it's the journey that matters. <br/><br/>I read "American Dirt" recently, a book about another of the great human migrations of our time. It's almost unfair to compare them, while "American Dirt" is flawed but enjoyable, this work is far superior, a grown up and serious book, gripping, moving and well written.
