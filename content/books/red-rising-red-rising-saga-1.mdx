For me this is YA sci-fi, not sci-fi. High ratings and inclusion in best of sci-fi lits swung my purchase. Saying that, as YA sci-fi it is very good, better than the hunger games which i also enjoyed. Felt aimed at a slightly older age group. Rating as a sci-fi book would be 3*. Fun concept, fun world building, great use of Roman/Greek history, bleak, moments a great suffering and injustice, good action sequences. The world building felt a little rushed at times, and the new societies delineations a little childish. Some of the story seemed very familiar. Much like dozens of coming of age stories set in brutal 'school' environments. Some nice twists, some obvious ones. Good fun overall!
