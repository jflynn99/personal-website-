A lovely read. Rovelli’s style is still brilliant - clear, warm, almost poetic - but this collection of essays didn’t hit as hard as his other books. Those have more depth and a stronger narrative that carries you through the big ideas. Here the writing is as good as ever, but the treatment is much more surface level.<br/><br/>The broader story is a tour of the breakthroughs that reshaped modern physics. Starting with Einstein’s revolution (the best one), to quantum weirdness, to the structure of the cosmos and even Rovelli’s own ideas about spacetime. He touches lightly on each of the seven “lessons” - relativity, quantum theory, the cosmos, particles, the graininess of space, time and entropy, and finally our place in all of it. All interesting, but never quite as immersive or gripping as his other work.<br/><br/>Still, it’s a sharp, engaging read on the key ideas that built the physics of today & some cool ideas about where it may go. Very good, just not Rovelli at full depth.
