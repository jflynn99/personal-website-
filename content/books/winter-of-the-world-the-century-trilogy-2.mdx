2.5* Part 2 of the century trilogy - more of the same.<br/><br/>Again the story is simplistic but effective, containing both interesting, little-known historical footnotes though often paired with dumbed down explanations by characters possessing almost magical foresight. <br/><br/>I thought there were too few characters in book one given the scope of the story, and we have the same flaw here. This time it's everyone's kids that become intertwined with each other in incredibly unlikely coincidences. Repeatedly. Our older generation are mostly sidelined. The multi-book story line reveals don't really pay off. <br/><br/>Carla is a well rounded character given a leading role. Unlike several of her co-leads. <br/><br/>The 'bad guy' Boy Fitzherbet, is a pathetic charachter, given a pathetic and pointless death. Though at least we do get main character death this time! Ancillary charachter death too. Much improved in this respect. <br/>The 'good' guy Lloyd is just Billy from book 1.<br/><br/>The main love story is formulaic but still enjoyable. A great moment in London. <br/><br/>The sections on the Nazi seasure of power, the Spanish civil war (especially the Soviet involvement) and the mass rape of German women by the soviets at the end of the war are excellent and the best parts of the book. <br/><br/>Again, the (consensual) sex scenes, rraaawww! <br/><br/>As before, super readable but not a top level work.
