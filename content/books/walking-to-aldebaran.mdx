A dark, fun and noticeably British sci-fi short story. <br/><br/>There are some really cool ideas and literary devices in this twisted tale. Quite a few (funny!) British jokes - lines about Tesco, stuff like that too. I was impressed despite not entirely liking our protagonist narrator... <br/><br/>I also missed several jokes and seemingly pointless plot points that horrified eight year old me once I realized - I had completely missed that this is a retelling of childhood favourite Beowulf! You don't need to know that to enjoy it, but it helps! :) won't be as shocking though...
