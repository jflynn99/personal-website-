Clearly a monumental work focusing on three of the luminaries of the Revolution. Unlike the Cromwell trilogy I was not as taken in by the characters (though I think they are brilliantly and faithfully portrayed) and at times I was a little confused, though that is more a comment on me rather than the book. It was a confusing time!<br/><br/>For me the part on their early years is too long, not poorly written but not terribly exciting. The novel sparks into life with the action of the Revolution and the political intrigues it creates. The domestic scenes here make a nice juxtaposition to the standard history of the public deeds. <br/><br/>It also gives us the emotional payoff with the betrayals at the end, though I thought it could have carried on a few more weeks to see us through to the grisly end of all the major protagonists.
