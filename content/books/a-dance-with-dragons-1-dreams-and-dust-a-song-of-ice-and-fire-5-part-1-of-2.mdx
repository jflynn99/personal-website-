Nothing new to report here, more of the very best fantasy and one of the very best series I've ever read. <br/><br/>By way of slight criticism, you can feel the structural effects caused by splitting the stories occuring at the same time with the last book, it will only really come back together in part 2 of this one - the stopping point here is clearly a mid point not an end, lengthy yes but other than the page count and your wrists there is no need to spilt ADWD like this. <br/><br/>I read alongside "Words of Radiance" part 2 of the other great ongoing fantasy saga - it allows me to compare and contrast directly for once. GOT feels a bit more grown up, the story seems more expansive, it's more political. Though both are excellent, I do prefer GOT.  <br/><br/>Heartly recommend 'A History of Westeros' podcast re-read Valar reredis project to accompany, so much to catch that is easily missed!
