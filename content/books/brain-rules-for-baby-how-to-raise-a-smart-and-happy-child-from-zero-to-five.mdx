A super informative and quite fun read for lost, soon to be first time parents like me. <br/><br/>I appreciate the authors (a developmental molecular biologist) punchy, straight to the point style, and found the personal anecdotes amusing and worthwhile. It won't work for everyone. (I may have liked it more as I listened to the audio version that is read by the author and liked his voice and pacing). <br/><br/>Crystal clear on what science does say, does not say, and what we are unsure of. Opinions always stated as such. Structured well, containing facts, practical advise, and a good touch of reassuring wisdom. Links to ongoing debates through active, well referenced websites.<br/><br/>A bit US focused in parts, but I won't hold it against the work ;)
