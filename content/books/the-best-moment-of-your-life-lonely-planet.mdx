Nice coffee table book with a double page story and great photos of 100 'best (travel) moments of my life' from Lonely Planet contributors. <br/><br/>The quality varies from insightful and 'take me there now' to self indulgent and 'never send me there'. Some useful practical tips added to each one too.
