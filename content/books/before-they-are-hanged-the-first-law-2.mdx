Yeesss this is the good stuff. Having read books from several of the other top Game of Thrones-like series, I can say this is my favorite of them by some margin. Smart, brutal and incentive. <br/><br/>One of the main reasons I like this series so much is the greyness of all characters - everyone is warts n'all and it makes it a much more enjoyable read. It's very funny. <br/><br/>The story picks up just after the events of book one, but I feel this book is better; there's less exposition, and the slightly boring love story is parked, then literally twisted forever. The mystery develops and grows. <br/><br/>It feels like there is non stop action, yet the main plot boils along in the background. You will be surprised and intrigued. <br/><br/>The book is well structured, very entertaining but I must mention two outstanding areas of writing, sex and vicious battles. Hey, if you are going to be a world class writer be good in exciting areas! <br/><br/>The sex scenes are really good, after reading some truly terrible ones recently I can better appreciate the skill. And wow, away from the brilliant big picture battle strategy, the book gets truly visceral. West's (fully deserved) new nickname "Furious" is apt. I've not read violence done so well since Game of Thrones.
