Decent but unspectacular literary Sci Fi.<br/><br/>This is a well constructed and written time travel book that touches on several interesting areas without ever going too deep. <br/><br/>Time travel is explored at the surface level, the bureaucratic system is cleverly thought out but little else.<br/><br/>Simulation theory is a core theme, but is dismissed with a "so what?" if it's all a simulation what's important is that we feel it. I tend to agree, but a little more would have been nice. <br/><br/>This is a sequel of sorts to The Glass Hotel which I have not read, though I don't think it makes a huge difference. <br/><br/>It is neither as ambitious or as good as Station Eleven. There is an entire character who is very much the author and her experiences during covid, again somewhat interesting but nothing spectacular. The others are all a bit meh.
