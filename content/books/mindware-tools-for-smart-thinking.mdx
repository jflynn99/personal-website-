Good if uneven book on 'thinking tools' or rather on thinking flaws humans have and how to see, understand, and limit them. <br/><br/>Mostly a phycology book that surveys the current understanding of both the big hitters of the field and the authors (good) work. So you have lots of Kahneman and Tversky, Thaler, Levitt and Taleb - well summarised and criticised where appropriate.  <br/><br/>You also have good chapters on statistics and probability - how poor people are in general and how easy it is to teach people 'tools' that he can show stick with them - good work here. <br/><br/>I feel this would be an excellent book for a budding 16-18 year old student, I have read much of the work in the original formats so some parts felt a bit 101. Good to go over others. A few were new to me and explained very well - multivariate regression in particular.
