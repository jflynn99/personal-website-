A reluctant five stars - not that this book is not outstanding, it is, or that it is weaker compared to book 1, it's stronger, but I have a real affinity for books that kill off major characters - and here I was a little let down, lots of promise but little payoff. I could be proved wrong in the long run, but I felt a little shortchanged in that respect.<br/><br/>I read at the same time as a GOT book, it allowed me to contrast the two best fantasy series I've touched upon. The Stormlight Archive is more fantastical, a little more tropey and a little less intricate. It has more action, truly brilliant pulsating action, feeling more like a blockbuster movie vs a long running TV series. <br/><br/>It's amazing that the book takes place in just 60 days - with a great flashback device to fill out Shallan - she really shines here. <br/><br/>I was more worried than intrigued by the shadesmar revelation at the end of book 1, it continues to be the area that puts me Ill at ease with this otherwise captivating and original world. <br/><br/>I will read on no doubt! but, more death please!
