The Status Game Revealed <br/><br/>In "The Status Game" by Will Storr, readers embark on an intellectually stimulating journey that delves into the intriguing and often perplexing world of human behavior through the lens of status games. Storr's exploration is both impressive and informative, leaving readers with a deep understanding of (at least one) the underlying forces that shape our actions and decisions.<br/><br/>At the heart of the book lies a compelling central thesis: humans are engaged in a perpetual game of status, where the primary objective is to ascend the social hierarchy and importantly, avoid being at the bottom. Storr expertly demonstrates how this game manifests itself in various contexts, influencing both individual behavior and the dynamics of societies. From ancient civilizations to modern-day cultures, the pursuit of status emerges as a constant driving force, impacting our lives in profound ways.<br/><br/>One of the book's key insights revolves around the significance of relative status over absolute status. Storr highlights that while money and power might lose their allure once enough is attained, the pursuit of higher social standing knows no bounds. Billionaires don't stop playing once they get rich! This captivating notion sheds light on the motivations behind some of humanity's most remarkable achievements and, conversely, its most devastating disasters.<br/><br/>The book has a good section on the changes made by the church in Europe in the middle ages concerning marriage & inhertance. I have read before on the immese (and unintended) cosenquences of the huge efforts to stop people having a jolly good time with thier first cousins. The church wanted more money, so it chsnged the status game; it spawned a new society based on the family unit (vs clans) and provided the inpetus for huge ecomonic and social upheval.<br/><br/>"The Status Game" also delves into the biological and psychological ramifications of low status, revealing how it can lead to adverse health effects, mainly through stress and inflammatory responses. These may be impacted via diet & poverty, intertwined but seperate causes. <br/><br/>Through insightful examples, Storr demonstrates the intertwining of status with moral judgments and how individuals may justify morally questionable acts within the context of their particular status game. Some of the examples are extreme, a tactic i like! But expect to read about normalized, in fact encouraged, child abuse. And not only in the past. <br/><br/>Here in the present, the book shines a light on the powerful influence of social media and cults, both of which capitalize on the human need for connection and status. Storr explores how those who fail to succeed in mainstream societal status games may seek solace and recognition in smaller, alternative subcultures. You may be out of one game but will soon join another. <br/><br/>Storr's analysis of the impact of status on recent historical events, such as Trump's rise to power and the Brexit phenomenon, is particularly enlightening. He convincingly argues that relative status plays a pivotal role in shaping political landscapes and public opinion. It was many in the 'lower classes' who felt their relative decline compared to those around them, even if in absloute ecomonic terms their circumstances had improved that voted for a hard change.<br/><br/>Throughout the book, Storr delves into the lives of infamous figures, particulary Lenin and Stalin, revealing how personal humiliations and losses of status drove these individuals to seek power and influence, with disastrous consequences for millions. Insightful yet this is not the whole story. I really felt the overeach in sections like this, with the author hammering home the books key theme with abandon, missing some heavy duty historical rivets. <br/><br/>One of the book's significant takeaways is the assertion that equality is an impossible dream. Storr contends that the desire for status and social recognition is innate, making it a fundamental aspect of human nature. However, he wisely acknowledges that through acknowledging this aspect of ourselves and striving for a balanced understanding of human motivations we can be happier. This syncs well with how I responed to a professor's question back in university 'if we had unimited stuff, everything in abudabce for all, would humans still be in conflict?" Yes i think so!<br/><br/>At times i feel the authour shows his journalistic background, a clumsy at best use of statistics at one point and a glossing over of alternate hypothosis that would not have gone down well in an academic book, but these are minor blemishes on a very good book. <br/><br/>"The Status Game" concludes with a thought-provoking proposition: the purpose of life is not to win the status game but to play it. Storr encourages readers to embrace the game as an integral part of the human experience, and in doing so, find a greater sense of fulfillment and purpose.<br/><br/>Review in conjunction with chatGTP :)
