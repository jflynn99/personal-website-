Having watched and loved (for the most part) the TV show, I have embarked on the books. I expected them to be better and so far this has been true. The added details, foreshadowing, and excellent general writing are all a joy. <br/><br/>Already having a face for the names helps, except in the cases where the show and book differ, then it's hard to break out of the images in my head. <br/><br/>Even knowing all major plot points I remained gripped, shocked, and enthralled. Reading along with the History of Westeros podcast really adds to the experience too. <br/><br/>The world and stories created here, so close to episodes and peoples from our past sucks history nerds like me in, the brilliant storytelling keeps me coming back for more. <br/><br/>I was inspired by the show to try out the fantasy genre, I was disappointed with Gene Wolf's The Shadow of the Torturer, but thoroughly enjoyed The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss. Even without my priming I am sure I would have considered this a class above.
