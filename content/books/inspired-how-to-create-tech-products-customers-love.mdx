5* and an essential book for Product Managers - 4* modern tech business book, not super useful for anyone else! <br/><br/>Really sets the ground, and builds a framework for top class modern product management. I should have read it before I started! <br/><br/>More practical than the excellent "The Lean Startup" the book is full of actionable steps, things to avoid and real life examples. It is also fantastic at talking about high level strategy questions, as well as day to day tactical insights. <br/><br/>Immediately helped with my job,  and will do so for years!
