My second of his books, if anything even better than the wonderful Helgoland. <br/><br/>It is on the face of it a popular science book, a popular physics book, yet his grasp of English and depth of thought makes it both a work of literature and a mini philosophical treatise too. <br/><br/>We start with the science - I am not qualified to adjudicate if his preferred explanations are true or likely, but they are explained wonderfully - even the parts that genuinly make no sense to anybody. <br/><br/>Some of the facts, and their possible implications are astounding. Worth reading again and again. Truly the stuff to inspire generations. <br/><br/>Later we branch out into what this means for us as conscious individuals - these parts are better than almost all the philosophy and science I have read on the subject. <br/><br/>Could not recomend this short book with more vehemance, love that he could mention both LSD and psychedelic mushrooms as well. A new personal hero.
