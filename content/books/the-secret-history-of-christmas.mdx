Excellent, as expected, short book by the beloved Bryson. <br/><br/>I think this is an Audible only special read by the man himself. We are taken on a fact-a -minute and funny tour of the whole of Christmas. <br/><br/>It's fascinating to see just how this crazy amalgamation of disparate traditions have fused to become the thing we know and love so dearly. <br/><br/>We have a great exploration of the source of our traditions, often older, darker and racier than you may imagine, and some great myth busting, no Coca Cola didn't invent Santa, though they did make his suit red!
