I had not heard of Gene Wolfe before his passing last year, it made serious news, so with it coinciding with my mini quest to explore fantasy in greater depth I selected this work. <br/><br/>I did not get into it. There are some good aspects, it is eerily atmospheric, and very well written, a grown up fantasy work for sure. <br/><br/>The story is punctuated with interesting moral and philosophical points, a notable passage on crowds acting like a species sticks in the mind. There are some cool biotech weapons (literally), but in general the book is slow on world building, to the extent I still know little of the world by the end.<br/><br/>The intriguing setting, of a world that has had but somehow lost the power to travel to the stars before regressing (?) to a medieval like state feels underexplored. You remain very time bound despite the occasional dangle of further knowledge. Hampered by the single point of view format. <br/><br/>The structure too didn't sit right with me personally. A teasing dramatic opening (left pretty much untouched by the end), a fairly standard apprenticeship story leading to the the kernel of a quest, then some weird and confusing love based dramas. <br/><br/>We don't get very far on that journey. I know this is book one of four, but as the closing lines read "if you wish to walk no further then I don't blame you, it's no easy road" well, yeah I agree, and I don't think I will.
