Outstanding popular science book by of of the best in the business. Engaging, enlightening, elegantly written. <br/><br/>The book takes us on a tour of the rapidly growing field of microbiology, demonstrating their crucial importance to species (including humans) and entire ecologies. Useful when thinking about the world and practically useful in living your life, not many science book can pull both off. <br/><br/>Several themes I have came across before in the press or science blogs, even these capture the interest due to the quality of the writing. Bringing to life even the gross parts about fecal transplants (featuring an unfortunate blender!).<br/><br/>Only minor quibble would be that even at a few years old large stride have already taken place that will of course not be present, that is most clear in the final chapter which feels a little threadbare compared to all of the others.
