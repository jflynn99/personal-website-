The Terror<br/><br/>Brilliant historical fiction with a supernatural edge.<br/><br/>Moody, atmospheric, and dark, this would have been an excellent telling of the doomed Royal Navy voyage to the Arctic during the 1840s without any enticing extras. <br/><br/>The supernatural edge takes it a notch higher, it is done in a tactful and original way, juxtapositioning Innuit culture with the hardwired hubristic nature of the Victorian mindset. Highlighting its racist and classist pitfalls along the way.<br/><br/>This element does not fully come out until the end of a fairly long novel, though at no point did the read feel like a chore. The staggered timeline, while not to everybody's taste, helps with this as did the vividly dramatic action scenes.<br/><br/>I read this work based on the authors outstanding Hyperion sci-fi series, this is of course very different but again shows his top notch writing ability. I thought several times it would make a fine film, full of tension and paranoia, like 'The Thing' in the 19th century, and it turns out it has already been made into a well regarded series.
