Enjoyable short escapades in Westeros a century or so before the main series. <br/><br/>Simpler by design than the main series with just the single POV and short time spans, the stories are remarkably vivid and engaging. I'm left wanting more but not feeling that anything was missed out. <br/><br/>I read these as a collection and I could feel the change of tone through the three. From a self contained and straightforward (though foundational) story at first, through a more complex second featuring dreams and tales of defining battles elsewhere, to a story where we are the protagonists at the center of an rebellion meeting top level players - I could almost feel George desperately trying to stop himself writing a full series on the Blackfyre rebellions - though I'd happily take that!  <br/><br/>Dunc and Egg are both 'good' and likable characters, not as grey as most in the main series - plenty of grey in those we meet. Dunc is a representation of a true knight like his suspected descendent Brienne, Egg seems likely to have made a wise ruler - interesting to see what happens on the long road to Summerhall. <br/><br/>The only strong link to the main series comes through Bloodraven - not mentioned (or even  named by George at that time I believe) at first, later met. A dark and complex character - very grey and with lots of potential for Bran's future. We see a baby Walder Frey too! but the rest is ancestors and parallels - for more info here check out the excellent History of Wrsteros podcasts. <br/><br/>There are many comic moments - often at the perceived expense of the self depreciating, socially intelligent but uneducated 'Dunk the lunk'. <br/><br/>Would love to read more, preferably after TWOW though!
