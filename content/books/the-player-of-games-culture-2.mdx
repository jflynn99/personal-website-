The second book of the well regarded series, and very different to the first. I had really enjoyed Consider Phelibas, though noticed it was both lower rated than others in the series and often came with guidence to read another first. I see why now. <br/><br/>The first is a great story very much in the military sci-fi anti-hero mould. Good but of that genre. Not for everyone. While this is quite unlike anything I've read. Nothing to do with space wars, here we explore the Culture but mostly another civilization through the game Azad. A game that is the central unifying force of a whole empire. Original and fascinating. <br/><br/>Like the best in sci-fi the book is smart, inventive, and a sharp comment on ideas, values, and structures of our own society. There are great lines on the philosophy of empire, on human AI relations, post-scarcity bordom, and cool new technology, there's a prison suit that sticks in the mind! <br/><br/>On AI relations in particular we can see who is in charge, the AIs manipulate (or at best persuade)  a willing human into carrying out their grand, interventionist and destructive plans.<br/><br/>I particularly enjoyed the many slights to our own culture, the book looks incredibly prescient on topics including fake news, distraction of the masses by courupt elites, toxic masculinity...though this probably just highlights that these are not new things. <br/><br/>Also like the first book sections can be brutal, gross, or funny. Some are several at the same time - look out for the song "lick me out"!<br/><br/>We build to a well thought out and spectacular grand finale, though the very end was a tad predictable. <br/><br/>Can't wait for the next one.
