Another first rate installment of this excellent series.<br/><br/>Book six is very much the direct sequel to the previous book, with that story wrapping up as expected but in a typically inventive and thrilling way. <br/><br/>The longer term plot is hinted at, but not exacly propelled along via Epstein drive. Hopefully more development there next time. <br/><br/>All of our big hitters are involved here, along with the introduction and fleshing out of many secondary characters, possibly the book with the most POVs? Feels like there were many this time. We even have an unexpected death (!) <br/><br/>As usual, the book is particularly good at posing tough philosophical questions and zooming in on politics - "Politics is the art of what's possible, at our level grudges cost lives" along with the detailed emotional aspect of the interacting established cast. I would echo the thoughts of other reviewers who think that everyone kind of glossed over those billions of deaths fairly easily though :)
