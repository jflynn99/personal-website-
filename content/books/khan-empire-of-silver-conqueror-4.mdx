Great 5 star fun. A notable return to top form following the previous book that did not quite match the standard of the first few books. If you have read this far you know the drill, Mongolian politics, epic battles, sweeping historical narratives with a few laughs thrown in. You also accept the wide historical licence used to enhance that narrative. Even given that, I still feel I learned many lessons here. Good writing, especially on the importance of facial expressions and subtle, deferral movements. These passages really take you to the centre of huge power struggles.
