A major return to first rate high-impact (literally) sci Fi. The previous book was good, though it felt a little like a bottle episode. Here we blast back into the major plotlines and hurtle through space at some serious G's.<br/><br/>Like all the books we have a core theme or two, here it's family and terrorism. <br/><br/>We gladly learn a lot more about the origins and histories of our main crew. Mostly by splitting them up for most of the book. This really fills them out and it's a wonder we got this far without knowing!<br/><br/>The terrorism is cosmic in scope, shocking yet tastefully done with the personal insights we are given. Wild and wise!
