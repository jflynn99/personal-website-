"Humanity is at its best when it muddles through"<br/><br/>4.5* A thrilling part one of the end game for this outstanding series. It is a great stand alone book, but it (finally, some may say) introduces us to the big (human-ish) bad guy and sets us up for the finale. <br/><br/>It does this after pulling a sucsessful 30 year time jump! I did not see that coming but appreciate the reasons why. Nicely brushed over an immense clean up - something I can get on board with :)<br/><br/>Our core themes are aging, and democracy vs an all encompassing ideology. Nothing terribly original but a good lense to explore this universe and the characters we love through. <br/><br/>Our friends are creaking, and newer generations are coming through. It's in the post for all of us, and I liked seeing the 'last dance' play out here. It will make saying goodbye easier next time out. <br/><br/>The political aspect pitches 'Humanity' - you can read a form of basic 'democracy' vs rigid Ideology. <br/><br/>Humanity, it is noted is best when muddling through, working out compromises and workarounds. <br/>Ideology, a fixed belief in one certain way has an interesting twist. The bad guys here don't just think they are special, think their way is correct, with the utopian future just round the corner justifying anything as normal, here they do have something to back it up! Their technology and plan seem sure fire certainties...but is this the killer flaw? :)
