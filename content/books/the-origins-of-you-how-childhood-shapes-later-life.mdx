Solid science, tiresome writing. <br/><br/>A story of an ongoing and remarkable scientific project. A longitudinal study on human development. Informative, always true to the data and with some important results. I can't knock the science one bit.  <br/><br/>In the introduction one of the authors says he waited for a writer to come along to tell this story, but alas none came so they did it themselves. <br/><br/>You can tell, some aspects are repeatedly over explained - I may go nuts if I ever see "data 'pantry'" again. Yet there is also a lot of dense science writing too. Unsure of the target audience. Some of it was a true trudge to get through. The structure, of almost independent chapters, helps the casual reader but not those who read the whole book.
