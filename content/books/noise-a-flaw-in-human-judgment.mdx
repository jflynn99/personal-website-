DNF This book has the great honour of being the first I have actively given up on. With a limited amount of time and so many worthy books I can't slog through those I don't enjoy or see real value in. <br/><br/>I bought this because Daniel Kahneman is one of the authors and I have 'Thinking, fast and slow' as a foundational book in my understanding of the world. Having not read it in nearly 15 years so I wonder how it actually holds up? I know many of the studies included have since been discredited.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm confident this book is on sound academic grounds, but it's not very interesting. There is one core issue, it is mildly intriguing but is easily covered in the opening sections, it could be a long blog post. <br/><br/>I did trudge through another Cass Sunstein book, Nudge (3*), the writing here felt like that. I regretted that slog so I won't make it here. <br/><br/>Only for those in the field I feel.
