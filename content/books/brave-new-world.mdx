Quite strange conceptual sci Fi. 2.5*<br/><br/>There are some excellent philosophical parts of the book, some parts where we have almost a call to arms for humanity, humanity with all it's suffering and pain. This dovetails well with some excellent in jokes and what have been seen to be prescient predictions about the future (read today). <br/><br/>The replacement of "God" in both symbol and language with a cross becoming a "T" and the word "Ford" is hilarious and you see why it resonates so much today.<br/><br/>I think there are holes in the philosophical points, and in what many people see as predictions about our world - as detailed in "World of Things' by Frank Tenterbraum, the past was closer to today than we think, consumerism too. Just as easily you can read this as comments about his own time. <br/><br/>But none of that stopped my enjoyment. The story did however, I didn't find it exciting, there was little flow or closure and I never cared a bit about any character - most I expect we are not supposed to care for, in line with the happy but never excessive society portrayed. <br/><br/>I say never excessive, except in regards to sex! Haha racey for 1930s England! Lots of sex to go with the sweet sweet soma! Must have raised a few eyebrows!
