Remember me<br/><br/>Beautifully written and original historical fiction.<br/><br/>We have a 16th century domestic story, replete with marriage woes, chores, scandal, and a touch of plague. Spiced up by a hint of the supernatural, and a well done removal of a very famous someone from the spotlight. <br/><br/>Touching musings on marriage, loss, life and death. And a quite brilliant tangent exploring the route of the plague to Stafford. This is a self contained five star short story. <br/><br/>Brilliant ending.
