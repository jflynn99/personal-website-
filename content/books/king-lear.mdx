Dark, brutal and a perfect ending - shocking it was changed to a happier one for so long! Out of touch with the rest of the play. <br/><br/>I listened to the audio book, I feel you lose a little depth offered by either actors giving life to the words, or what you gain from a closer reading of the same words in text. But time well spent no doubt!
