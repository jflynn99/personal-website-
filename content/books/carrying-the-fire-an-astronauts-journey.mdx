Fascinating insight into the American space program from a unique and amiable perspective. <br/>Mike Collins comes across as a good egg, clearly skilled and capable, yet humble and down to earth. The stories of his drinking and smoking are endearing and a little shocking to our modern sensibilities! <br/>It is a perfectly pitched work, with complex engineering and science explained clearly without being dumbed down. Well written, and genuinely touching when talking about people and tragedy. <br/>The book takes in little of his early life, but most of his career - starting as an air force pilot, ending the narrative shortly after Apollo 11 - with some time for a thoughtful conclusion.  <br/>The sense of danger pervades, yet the spirit of (an American stamped) mission for all mankind shines through, inspiring.
