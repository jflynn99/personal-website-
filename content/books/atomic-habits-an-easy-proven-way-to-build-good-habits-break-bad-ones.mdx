Excellent, insightful, and concise book on the power and practicalities of habit formation. <br/><br/>I have read a bit of James Clear's work from his blog, I knew most of what would be here, yet interestingly I realised I had already incorporated several of the rules into my life. They have worked. I became a person who exercises everyday, I had made it part of my identity. <br/><br/>This at times simple book can change your life, slowly, little by little each day but it can. That's rare.<br/><br/>The science writing, particularly on psychology, is very well presented. You can read it elsewhere, but nowhere as clear and practically framed. He presents simple rules and methods for forming/breaking habits and through short vignettes displays their power. <br/><br/>You can see many apps today that use the same techniques to get you to come back for more, with positive/negative results depending on what ones. I love my 900+ day streak on the language learning app Duolingo, and the tracking of books on Goodreads encourages me to read more. <br/><br/>My only problem is with one habit I can't break. Eating the skin from my fingers. I have tried to break it, but its triggers and actions are so automatic and quick that I struggle to apply the rules and techniques laid out. I will try again.
