An exquisitely written and marvelously structured novella. <br/><br/>Both a hard sci-fi war story and a classic letterborn love story, just one that straddles all time. Neither perspective should put you off, the strength of both and their interplay is striking. <br/><br/>Some of the sci-fi elements are incredibly inventive (look out for Atlantis) and the romance is touching, very impressive given the short length. No words are wasted, a lovely reflection of the constrained letters agonised over in the story. <br/><br/>Leaves you with a thirst for more but with the impression that it would not be improved by extra volume, a quality whisky to be savoured, not overindulged.
