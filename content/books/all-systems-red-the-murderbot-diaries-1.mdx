A fun, thoughtful and tight novella. <br/><br/>We have a fairly standard but fun story of a security cyborg gone native played out in a Wild West mystery setting. <br/><br/>What elevates the book is the cyborg, the self styled 'muderbot' who is a hoot! Murderbot would much rather be watching daytime soaps than making anything secure or, God forbid, talking to people. Haha. <br/><br/>The world building is slick, there are surprises and it does not slip into sci fi tropes, it feels fresh and modern!
