"I like fish can I have it?"<br/><br/>Hahaha I doubted there could be a third part, with part 2 seemingly wrapping things up. What a total fuckwit I am. <br/><br/>How dare I question the incredibly inventive, cosmically brutal and truly twisted mind that spawned what is without doubt the best sci Fi series I've ever read, maybe plain just best series. <br/><br/>It's the best of the three, and incredibly still packed with shocking twists and black-as-oil-thrown-into-a-black-hole-at-night humor. Hahaha Australia, the next war fought with sticks indeed. The nuclear powered flying brain. The hope, the turns, the loss. Catastrophy.<br/><br/>It is beautiful too, the language around life in 4 dimensions is incredible, a whole new way of seeing and touching, visionary, literally. <br/><br/>The fairy tales are wonderous short stories in their own right, mind-blowing as parts of the plot. <br/><br/>At times so needless brutal, like when the autistic man throws himself into the black hole he helped create? Yes sad. But to add that the insurance refused to pay out as he is forever approaching death but not dead? Genius. <br/><br/>The casual, flippiant way entire species end. Breathtaking.<br/><br/>Profound too "Civilisation was like a mad dash that lasted 5 thousand years, progress begot more progress, countless miracles gave birth to more miracles, humankind seemed to posses the power of gods. In the end the real power was weilded by time. Leaving behind a mark was harder than creating a world."<br/><br/>Such a wild ending. The final section packs a lot in, it almost feels half finished, there are very statfying answers to big questions, and even more cold brutality! The sci part of sci-Fi is brilliant, the great war, truly universal weapons, attacks on laws of physics, meaning our laws of physics are war ruins! Almost degrading! Perspective shifting. The fiction part? not as strong or satisfying but still great. <br/><br/>The book makes it viceraly clear our minute importance in the great cosmic expanse, yet also brings home that it is all that matters, all it is to be human. <br/><br/>The darkness of the forest. It's hard to hope it's not true. It's genuinely scary. <br/><br/>All that is left is a fish.
