Scholarly, balanced, brilliant. <br/><br/>Somehow this mammoth work is a condensed version of the authors two previous Hitler biographies, Hubris and Nemesis, that split his life chronologically. For all except the academic I am sure this work suffices. <br/><br/>Really detailed and insightful of Hitler's early life, the Nazi rise to power, and then through searing highs, the lucky escapes, and ultimate destruction. <br/><br/>Does not get carried away with any unsubstantiated theory or rumor, and dismisses others. <br/><br/>Allows no excuses for the horror while looking for reasons on how and why it could have happened. Lessons for today there. <br/><br/>Minor note - would recommend Blitzed by Norman Ohler, a great read that maybe does go to far in some conclusions, but offers more on Hitler's drug use, it is discussed here but not all the facts were established at time of writing. Conclusions reached remain unchanged.
