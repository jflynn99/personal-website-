Once every year or so I come across a book so good I recommend it to everyone irrespective of their interests, this is such a book. <br/><br/>You don't need to be into the Silicon Valley or indeed the very niche blood testing scene to be taken on this wild ride of hubris, lies, and hilarity. <br/><br/>Brilliantly paced and structured - I listened to it and it plays like a first rate podcast - the scandal is steadily built with flashes of outrage (hi Sunny!), touching moments of sadness, grand delusion, brilliant humour, and  an overriding sense of WTF? It just gets bigger and bigger. <br/><br/>The list of 'luminaries' on the Theranos board is both damming, instructive, and very amusing.<br/><br/>I finish with the glorious song sang by the employees that must be music to the ears of any investigative reporter<br/><br/>"Fuck you Carreyrou!<br/>Fuck you Carreyrou!"<br/><br/>Hahaha
