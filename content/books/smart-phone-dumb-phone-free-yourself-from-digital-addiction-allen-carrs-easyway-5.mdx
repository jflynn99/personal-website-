This will work for some people, it has a certain style, and clearly defined steps that promise to free you from smartphone addiction. <br/><br/>I certainly reduced my use, seeing it in a new light, but I did not stick with it as I had hoped. <br/><br/>I characterize my phone addiction as a 'weak' addiction, more a habit, the best way is to remove the thing and you find you don't really miss it - i'd already left social media, but found my phone use did not really decline, it just shifted. <br/><br/>One of the main strategies here is that it's not a sacrifice, it's a shift from dependancy and dopamine hits to using it as a tool - when and how you need for a purpose. <br/><br/>I wanted to use it less around my kids, I'm slipping back into bad habits, but as mentioned for these dedicated and receptive the message here will work.
