An informative and breezy read through a remarkable football life.<br/><br/>Candid about his own mind, and quite depreciating of his huge achievements he spills little about his players or adversaries - not much juicy gossip! Not a huge amount of detail about individual games or tactics either. <br/><br/>A pean to hard work and constant improvement, a study in a principled, varied and honourable life.
