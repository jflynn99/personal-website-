Concise, completely free of self pity and maybe the very pinnacle of Existentialism - certainly so for me.<br/><br/>A story of the NAZI camps but really an introduction into his brand of very useful psychology - probably closer to a philosophy. <br/><br/>You will recognize many of the themes, the context just brings it viscerally to life. To live is to suffer, to survive is to find meaning in the suffering. This is a very stoic final freedom - to choose ones attitude to the circumstances you are presented with.<br/><br/>It is a life lived based on decisions not conditions. Plain to see in both attitudes from prisoners in camps, and in people who were sadistic guards yet super nice elsewhere! <br/><br/>Subtle but key reframing of questions provide real insight. <br/><br/>Happiness, like success cannot be pursued they can only ensue by dedication to something grater or someone else. I also like the thought that the Statue of liberty on east coast needs to be complimented and balanced with one of Responsibility on the west.
