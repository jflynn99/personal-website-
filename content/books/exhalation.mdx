Tinted Mirror<br/><br/>My first taste of reading Ted Chiang, thoroughly enjoyed it! <br/><br/>Struck me like a collection of Black Mirror episodes, except not as dark, tinted mirror if you will. <br/><br/>The stories are gripping, thoughtful, and entertaining. As with any collection some stand out over others, but all had their merits.<br/><br/>I especially enjoyed what I can only call historical sci fi, his stories set in the past, not the future or some distant star system. Helped to make it more real in a sense. <br/><br/>Some of them are brilliantly original, taking popular concepts and running a mile! The Entropy story and the Time Crystals standing out in that regard.<br/><br/>The story with the missionaries on the technology of language is a brilliant philosophy work. Just like the short but sweet one on free will. <br/><br/>Recommended.
