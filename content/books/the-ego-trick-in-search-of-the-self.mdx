Thought provoking, clearly written, and well argued throughout, an exemplary popular philosophy book.<br/><br/>The work grew out of the authors PhD work, and can be separated into 3 sections, a slightly slow opening half probing and then ruling out what the 'i' or a person really is. We then have a small and punchy statement of the central thesis, followed by a really interesting exploration of what that means.<br/><br/>The book feels modern and slips seemlessly between philosophy, science, phycology, and religion, often via interviews with leaders in these fields, without ever getting derailed by their at times conflicting views. Indeed, the author comes across as open, reasoned, and balanced, even when his own view differs from his subjects.<br/><br/>I already agreed with the central viewpoint of a bundle theory of mind, but as a testament to the structure and skill of the argument would struggle to see how you can argue against it without failing back to a faith in some form of the soul. <br/><br/>For people who think of themselves as fixed or stable over the long term it would also be an eye opening read! <br/><br/>I particularly enjoyed several philosophical and academic asdides, a small section on Wittigstien and a much needed critique of postmodernism stick in my mind.
