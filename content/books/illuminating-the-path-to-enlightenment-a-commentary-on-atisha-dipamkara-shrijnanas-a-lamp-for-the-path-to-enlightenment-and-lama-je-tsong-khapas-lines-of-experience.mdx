I was inspired to read more after hearing some stories about the Dalai Lama on a podcast, a truly fascinating person.<br/><br/>This book, free on Audible, is a good guide into Buddhism, Tibetan Buddhism in particular. It has a couple of key texts and interpretations along with some illuminating Q&A snippets. <br/><br/>It is clear and concise but not exactly what I was looking for. It highlights the Religious aspects of what I often thought of as a philosophy, it's clear to me now how it is a religion with a strong philosophical core. <br/><br/>Insightful, yet some of the mystical elements passed me by, as did some of the 'context' explaining some unsavory aspects like how it is considered a blessing to be born a man ! haha.<br/><br/>I will read more on the man himself I think that is what interested me, and keep meditating I do see the benefits of that.
