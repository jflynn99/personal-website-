A useful quick read that imparts wisdom and good practice, though without the depth or full scientific exploration that would make it a must read.<br/><br/>We follow branches from the anagram<br/><br/>(P)lay importance of , rules and growth<br/>(A)uthenticity <br/>(R)eframing <br/>(E)mpathy <br/>(N)o ultimatums<br/>(T)ogetherness and hygge<br/><br/>While juxtapositioning Danish and American norms (some people in both countries of course would beg to disagree). <br/><br/>There are thoughtful, useful, and scientifically backed sections in each. There are also fun asides and anecdotal stories. I certainly learned, or heard again, sold practical advice I will use. That alone makes it worthwhile. <br/><br/>Thre are also good parts on a more macro level - stats on medication of children and mental health issues stick in the mind, as do interesting theories as to why, it is here where we could have had more depth, another book it will have to be!<br/><br/>The contrasting framing tends to over emphasize the brilliance of the 'Danish model' while hammering the broken American one, and the caveat sections don't really cover that up. It's not entirely fair and not pertinent to a British reader. <br/><br/>Would recommend 'Brain rules for baby' by John Medina for the extra depth.
