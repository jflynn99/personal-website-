Wonderful and immersive historical fiction based on the life of possibly the most famous Japanese swordsman.<br/><br/>An immature teenager at the pivotal battle of Sekigahara, we follow Musashi's life, love, strife, and development over the next decade or so.<br/><br/>What makes the book stand out as more than a well written and wonderfully translated adventure story is the interweaving of Japanese (particularly martial) culture and philosophy within the narrative. Musashi's quest, 'the way of the sword'  becomes evermore philosophical, highlighting spiritual growth through personal struggle and strict ideals, and introducing us to other quintessential aspects of what we think of as Japanese culture - sculpture, ink painting, swordmaking, ceramics, and poetry. Many of these are introduced through famous historical figures. <br/><br/>Japanese philosophy permiates the book, most clearly with with Musashi's quest to become one with his sword, action, and surroundings - akin to the elimination of subject object distinction. This move towards oneness, involving the study, then removal of mental concepts overlayed by ourselves onto reality is wonderfully placed and paced into the text.   <br/><br/>I would offer criticism that this way or code is not questioned itself enough. True we are instructed that the way of the sword is not all about violence, rather that the philosophical aspects are more important, including gaining wisdom on how to rule and how to help society, yet this does not play out in the book outside of the main characters psyche. <br/><br/>Nor for a work from 1930s Japan does it offer clear criticism of the then prevelalent hyper nationalistic Bushido code that stemed from and hijacked core themes explored in the book. These glorified ideals helped wrought such misery and devestation for much of Asia, including ultimately Japan itself. It may be not the plcae for a historical fiction novel to do this, but i would argue it would be for literature of the time to do so. A careful reader may find the lessons, a casual one only the glory in Japanese martial culture.<br/><br/>The scope and immersion in a time is reminiscent of Tolstoy, as are the philosophical asides and day to day minucia. However, the tighter focus on a single character, along with the repetitive structure make is distinct. You can feel the original structure in parts, it was a serialised newspaper coloum, much like many of the great 19th century Russian works. Unlike them it is not as smooth read as a book, we face several similar cycles of starting anew, a fresh challenge, struggle and personal growth, large fight. I could see a modern editor cutting or blending some of those cycles to please more casual readers - it is very long at over 900 pages.<br/><br/>The story itelf builds and intensifies for those 900+ pages, only hitting a surprising turn late on. Most storylines are tied up (and together) nicely - even if some drift unexpectadly part way through. There are some spectacular battle scenes, and many funny moments, generally involving the famous Zen monk Takuan. There is a strange yet oddly touching section concerning a possible sexual assualt, and some of the language and actions concerning women, while undoubtedly accurate for the time could sit a little uneasy for some modern readers. <br/> <br/>Required reading for anyone interested in samurai era Japan. Though maybe not so for those that are not.
