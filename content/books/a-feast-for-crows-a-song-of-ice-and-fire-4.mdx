Outstanding again.<br/><br/>Quite a contravertislal book judging from some of the reviews and the info I get from the excellent History of Westeros podcast. It is a change of dynamic in large parts, and we have the beginning of two huge new plots that barely made it to the TV series.<br/><br/>For me this is exciting! Genuine mystery and new characters. And it's as dark as the seven hells! the Iron born plot in particular is ruthless and sails for even darker waters I hear! Awesome.<br/><br/>The foray to Dorne is good, not great until the final few sentences. Then great. <br/><br/>Our more established friends and foes are in top form too. Cersei's blind fall is hilarious and wonderfully paced, Jamie's improvement arc sees him well, improve (admittedly from a low base) but the real drama, and at times literal philosophical bite comes with Brienne and her not so merry gang. <br/><br/>Some of the finest writing of the whole series in her chapters. Profound, brutal stuff.
