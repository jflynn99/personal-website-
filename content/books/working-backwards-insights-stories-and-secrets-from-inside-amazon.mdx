Decent management and inside stories from 2 'Amazonians'. It has solid, replicable advice and great narratives of both the wildly successful and flat out failure kind. Great lessons from both. <br/><br/>Some of it is fairly radical, and the book reads like hard work at times, I'm sure this reflects the reality of working at Amazon. Unbelievably good at what they do, maybe not the most fun office though! <br/><br/>Some of the Jeff love is a little cringe worthy, but this is a top read for leaders or people interested in Amazon's successes over the years.
