Really good (and worrying!) view of the future of work and economics.<br/><br/>It is balanced and unsensational, this is no tech-optimist bible but nor is it a book of doom. A very good economics book that peers into the future balancing a wide range of economic theory and the changes wrought by modern technology. <br/><br/>I had came across a lot of the themes and information before, but it is well presented and delineated here. Especially the threat to white collar jobs, professionals are not safe! I was never bored, but not gripped. Sections I was not familiar with I enjoyed the most, generally later in the book. It is a little too US focused. <br/><br/>
