This is fine, detailed work that delivers what it promises. I read it after seeing it repeatedly recommended from voices I admire. <br/><br/>My only criticism is that it feels like a textbook. A good one but a textbook. Lots of it is dense, jargon heavy text that assumes good economic and financial knowledge. It is structured thematically and jumps around in history to give examples, there's no gripping narrative - not that one was intended. Many sections became quite the slog, despite the undoubted authority and expertise of the authors. <br/><br/>I feel a well written blog post per theme could have taught me as much, l I knew the basics of most of them already from such sources, though not all the details or examples. And despite all of this it could not stop me keeping some mania investments even as I warned others off them! hahaha
