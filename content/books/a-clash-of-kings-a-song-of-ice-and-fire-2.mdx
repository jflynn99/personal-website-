Again I must state and am a fan of the TV series now reading the books. This is both notably better than the TV series, but somewhat unexpectedly better than the first book too.<br/><br/>It's darker, often brutal, and even twisted. It adds both extra narrative and characters vs the TV series, a clear divergence that I'm sure only expands as the story develops. But more importantly it also so much depth to the main protagonists. Several come out much better, Sansa in particular, while others come off even worse! Theon and little finger stood out for me in that respect. <br/><br/>Some truly beautiful writing too, in terms of evocative descriptions of beauty and horror, and of emotional destitution. Brilliantly structured reveals and shocking turns of events. <br/><br/>Are there any other similar series this good?
