It is data driven, packed with clear and actionable insights, and framed around memorable stories like the Sydney Opera House, Heathrow Terminal 5, and the Olympics. The long case study of the Brooklyn couple doing a home renovation felt slightly out of place at times, but it is also very practical for normal people, especially if you have lived through your own mini construction situations!<br/><br/>Flysjberg’s core message can be summed up as: think slow, act fast. Spend serious time understanding what you are trying to do, why you are doing it, and how it has gone for others in the past. Then, once that groundwork is done, move quickly while the window of opportunity is open. The longer a project lingers half committed, unfinished, the more chances it has to fail.<br/><br/>Why are you doing this project?<br/><br/>One of the most useful ideas in the book is the insistence on a clear ""why"". Drawing on the architect Frank Gehry, Flyvbjerg describes the need to ""fill in the box on the right"": define the underlying problem, then outline the steps that will actually solve it. That simple discipline separates vanity projects from serious ones.<br/><br/>Linked to this is the idea of technology as embedded experience. The humble carrot peeler is an example of embodied test and learn, the physical outcome of many cycles of trial, error, and refinement. Good architecture is ""embodied music"" in the same sense, it crystallises experience.<br/><br/>Experience, experiment, and reference class forecasting<br/><br/>The book keeps coming back to the Latin root experiri, which underpins both ""experience"" and ""experiment"". You need both. Use what has already been delivered, off the shelf, by experienced people. Custom and bespoke sound glamorous, but in project terms they are often a red flag. Iterative processes and repeated patterns are safer.<br/><br/>This is where reference class forecasting (RCF) comes in. Instead of pretending you can magically predict cost and time from first principles, you pick a similar project as your baseline. You anchor your forecast in how long and how expensive it was in the real world, unknown unknowns included. According to Flyvbjerg, this approach is dramatically more accurate than traditional forecasting because it is grounded in reality rather than optimism.<br/><br/>I did raise an eyebrow at the positive HS2 example, which is interesting on paper but looks much less flattering given what we now know about the project’s later failures. That said, the underlying point stands: big, one off projects full of ""black swan"" events like archaeology, politics, and novelty are exactly where reference class thinking is most needed.<br/><br/>Psychology, stories, and the cost of failure<br/><br/>The book is very good on the psychology of big projects. Flyvbjerg goes after the popular myth of the lone creative or dropout genius who bends reality through sheer will. <br/><br/>Stories are seductive, and project managers love them. Survivorship bias means we constantly replay the few big success stories and ignore the vast graveyard of failures. Optimism bias in planning is dangerous, yet you still need some energy and drive to get anything built at all. That tension for PMs comes through clearly. Based on the data he quotes, true sucsessful outlier projects are rare, maybe one in five. The other 80% are disasters, often with very long tail distributions of cost and time overruns.<br/><br/>Another great sections leverages economics and looks at opportunity cost. When a grand project overruns or fails, it is not just the direct costs that hurt. All the other work that could have been done instead simply disappears. The opera house designer who was blamed and effectively exiled from the profession is a good example: we lost not just his reputation, but all the buildings he might have created afterwards.<br/><br/>Power, politics, and stakeholders<br/><br/>Flysjberg is blunt about power and vested interests. You need to know who actually holds power in your project and who has special interests at stake. The Olympics feature heavily as an example of some of the worst spending and overrun patterns in history. Every Games is treated as a one off, run by inexperienced locals who insist on uniqueness, and the result is almost always waste on a spectacular scale.<br/><br/>Modular construction and ""What is your Lego?""<br/><br/>One of my favourite themes is modularity. Repetition is the mother of learning. Modular construction, when done well, is ""magic"" because it gives you scale without losing control. Flyvbjerg points to high end cars as proof that modular, repeatable systems can still be beautiful and high quality. <br/><br/>He also shows that the most successful types of projects in his database, in terms of time and cost, are the highly modular ones: solar farms, then wind, then coal and gas plants, electricity transmission, and roads. At the other end of the spectrum you find nuclear waste storage and the largest nuclear plants, plus mega events like the Olympics. These projects combine complexity, novelty, politics, and long time horizons in a way that invites disaster.<br/><br/>This all leads to the key question: what is your Lego? What are the units, modules, or patterns you can repeat, refine, and scale, instead of treating everything as bespoke?<br/><br/>The 11 heuristics<br/><br/>The book closes with 11 practical heuristics that act as a simple checklist for anyone leading projects, big or small:<br/><br/>Hire a masterbuilder: choose a leader with deep domain experience and a proven track record.<br/><br/>Get your team right: build a strong, experienced team, ideally one the masterbuilder has worked with before.<br/><br/>Ask ""why?"": clearly understand the ultimate goal and purpose of the project.<br/><br/>Build with Lego: use modular, replicable components; start small and scale up.<br/><br/>Think slow, act fast: invest time in thorough planning before moving quickly into execution.<br/><br/>Take the outside view: learn from similar projects; use real world data and reference classes.<br/><br/>Watch your downside: identify and mitigate risks; focus on avoiding catastrophic failures.<br/><br/>Say no and walk away: stay focused, avoid distractions, and be willing to abandon projects with poor prospects.<br/><br/>Make friends and keep them friendly: build and maintain strong relationships with key stakeholders.<br/><br/>Build climate mitigation into your project: integrate sustainability and climate considerations from the start.<br/><br/>Know that your biggest risk is you: recognise and manage your own biases and blind spots as a leader.<br/><br/>Verdict<br/><br/>For me, this is a very strong mix of narrative, data, and practical advice. The Brooklyn renovation story runs a little long compared to the mega projects, but it does make the lessons feel applicable to ordinary readers. If you care about how big projects actually work, or you manage any kind of complex initiative yourself, this is well worth your time.",,,1,0
53916142,A Life on Our Planet: My Witness Statement and a Vision for the Future,David Attenborough,"Attenborough, David",,"=""1538719983""","=""9781538719985""",4,4.50,Grand Central Publishing,Hardcover,272,2020,2020,2025/11/28,2025/03/25,"natural-science, science, biography, climate","natural-science (#1), science (#9), biography (#1), climate (#1)",read,"This fine book by British national treasure Sir David Attenborough is part memoir, part witness statement, and part call to action. He uses the story of his own long and fascinating life as a frame for the immense changes in the natural world over the last century, switching between personal anecdotes, global data, and a clear-eyed view of what we have done to the planet.<br/><br/>Attenborough threads both pessimism and optimism through the book, and backs both with science. We have undoubtedly wrought huge damage, ecosystems degraded, species lost, and atmospheric carbon rising relentlessly. In 1937, when he was eleven, the world population was about 2.3 billion, atmospheric carbon 280 ppm, and remaining wilderness roughly 66 %. By 2020, at ninety-three, those numbers had shifted to 7.8 billion people, 415 ppm, and only 35 % wilderness. The contrast is stark and he does not sugar-coat it.<br/><br/>To its credit, this is not a book of leftist doom or vague moralising. I was a bit worried by the opening framing around Chernobyl, which can feel like a heavy-handed metaphor at first, but the way he returns to it at the end works well. The exclusion zone in Ukraine has effectively become an outstanding natural reserve simply because people left. Wildlife has thrived. Attenborough uses this to underline a simple point our presence is powerful, but it is also ephemeral, and nature is surprisingly quick to reclaim space when given the chance.<br/><br/>Stylistically, it is very much Attenborough, clear, calm, and quietly urgent rather than shouty. He repeats a few key ideas, like the need for “wisdom” rather than just intelligence, and the reminder that our planet is “small, isolated and vulnerable”. These are not new concepts if you have read much climate or environmental writing, but hearing them distilled in his voice, anchored in a lifetime of direct observation, gives them extra weight.<br/><br/>At the same time some genuine improvements are a little ignored. Forested area has been expanding in many parts of the world for decades, some species have been brought back from the brink, and there are examples of successful conservation and smarter land use. It is not a wall of despair, which makes the warning land more strongly.<br/><br/>Why four stars and not five? Mainly because, for me, it sits slightly awkwardly between genres. It is not quite a full autobiography, and not quite a deep technical book on climate science or ecology, so readers who want one or the other in depth might feel a little under-served. The solutions section is OK but high level, and if you already follow these topics closely, much of it will feel familiar. And i disagree that say there are too many people or that we need to reduce consumption - we just need to do it in a green way. I am sure it is possible. Not sure it is probable. <br/><br/>That said, it is a thoughtful, humane, and often moving summary of where we are and how we got here, written by someone uniquely placed to tell that story. As an accessible overview of the planetary crisis from a voice almost everyone trusts, it is hard to beat.",,,1,0

Those have more depth and a stronger narrative that carries you through the big ideas. Here the writing is as good as ever, but the treatment is much more surface level.<br/><br/>The broader story is a tour of the breakthroughs that reshaped modern physics. Starting with Einstein’s revolution (the best one), to quantum weirdness, to the structure of the cosmos and even Rovelli’s own ideas about spacetime. He touches lightly on each of the seven “lessons” - relativity, quantum theory, the cosmos, particles, the graininess of space, time and entropy, and finally our place in all of it. All interesting, but never quite as immersive or gripping as his other work.<br/><br/>Still, it’s a sharp, engaging read on the key ideas that built the physics of today & some cool ideas about where it may go.

The “fivesome” of heroes are fun is a little simplistic, the one with mild magical tendencies is an odd but amusing touch. The action scenes are well done, though the main cast never feel in real danger. Some dialogue leans a bit forced and heavy on exposition.<br/><br/>I loved Iggulden’s Sharpe series as a kid and his Genghis Khan Conqueror series more recently, this one doesn’t quite reach those heights but still hits the spot if you’re a fan of the author or the era.",,,1,0

Vonnegut opens by half-telling his own story, then hands it off to Billy Pilgrim, who slips in and out of time like a faulty radio. The famous bombing of Dresden is telegraphed from the first pages, but you don’t actually get there until very late in the book- after detours through a dreary middle-class American life enlivened by a trip to Tralfamadore, a planet where the ailiens experince time differntly (all at once) where Billy is enstalled in an alien zoo.<br/><br/>It’s deliberately jarring. The writing lurches between deadpan absurdity, black humour, and blunt horror. One moment Vonnegut himself is cameoing “shitting his brains out”, the next Billy is drifting through suburban America or lying in the rubble of Dresden. The result is a book that feels scattered, even unserious, it;s probably the point - trauma doesn’t present itself neatly. Memory doesn’t run in straight lines.<br/><br/>Billy himself is written to be almost aggressively bland, which makes the violence stand out sharper and the humour more grotesque. You laugh at times, but the laughter curdles quickly. The book most reminded reminded me of the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy if you stripped out the British whimsy and left only the bleakness.<br/><br/>As an anti-war novel, it’s unusual because it doesn’t argue, persuade, or moralise. Instead it shows you either s fractured mind trying to process a world that no longer makes sense, or some weird aliens, and it forces you to sit with that. I admired the experiment and laughed at some of the darker jokes, but I can’t say I loved the reading experience and i am a lirrlt suprpised at its ""classic"" status.<br/><br/>Overall: a strange, influential book that has major anti-war credentials that are not as obvious as say ""all quiet on the Western front"" - it maybe works more as a cultural artefact than a story I’d want to revisit.<br/><br/>*I checked at the nubers for the dead from the Dresden boombing are far in excess of what historians now think - but were the estimations at the time.

I see why now. <br/><br/>The first is a great story very much in the military sci-fi anti-hero mould. Good but of that genre. Not for everyone. While this is quite unlike anything I've read. Nothing to do with space wars, here we explore the Culture but mostly another civilization through the game Azad. A game that is the central unifying force of a whole empire. Original and fascinating. <br/><br/>Like the best in sci-fi the book is smart, inventive, and a sharp comment on ideas, values, and structures of our own society. There are great lines on the philosophy of empire, on human AI relations, post-scarcity bordom, and cool new technology, there's a prison suit that sticks in the mind! <br/><br/>On AI relations in particular we can see who is in charge, the AIs manipulate (or at best persuade)  a willing human into carrying out their grand, interventionist and destructive plans.<br/><br/>I particularly enjoyed the many slights to our own culture, the book looks incredibly prescient on topics including fake news, distraction of the masses by courupt elites, toxic masculinity...though this probably just highlights that these are not new things. <br/><br/>Also like the first book sections can be brutal, gross, or funny. Some are several at the same time - look out for the song ""lick me out""!<br/><br/>We build to a well thought out and spectacular grand finale, though the very end was a tad predictable. <br/><br/>Can't wait for the next one.",,,1,0

I think this is because I love fewer characters, and the plot, while twisting and surprising, is not as mysterious or complex. More black and white compared to shades of grey. <br/><br/>While I'm sure all fans were as happy as me to see more of Nicomo Cosca, I was not as thrilled to find more of the acrid Vitari. Caul Shivers, the other main protagonist, has a compelling story – though it occasionally feels a little like ""Logen lite"" – the tough, unlucky but good-hearted (and occasionally very angry) Northerner, who, lacking purpose, embarks on a terrible downward spiral. <br/><br/>Revenge is the main theme of the book, and we do viscerally feel it. It feels good as a reader, but not so much for the characters themselves – is it an empty motivator? <br/><br/>The A-cast characters from the original trilogy have either walk-on parts or exist only in the thoughts of our current players. I respect the artistic choice there – much more to come, of course. <br/><br/>As with the trilogy, this book doesn’t shy away from gritty detail – the violence and sex scenes are raw, vivid, and often brilliantly uncomfortable. One passage, with two of the stars who turn out to be with other people, was brilliantly executed. Wonderful writing. <br/><br/>On a grander scale, the eternal war rages on. We learn quite a bit more without interacting with any main players. This was fun, but one new player in this game felt very deus ex machina.

It’s a rare thing to find a book that both blows your mind with its depth of scientific insight and leaves you grappling with philosophical implications long after you put it down.<br/><br/>This too is a book with an ambitious goal - to demystify the origins of consciousness and feelings by grounding them in the free energy principle. And, for my money, it largely succeeds.  What’s more, it sheds light on the interplay between biology, physics, neuroscience, and even ethics in ways that feel both dazzling and in some ways deeply unsettling. This puts it right at the top of the list of work on consciousness. <br/><br/>Deconstructing Our Assumptions<br/><br/>The book starts by dismantling the common idea that consciousness is tied to the higher brain functions alone. Instead, it makes a case for feelings as the true bedrock of consciousness - older than memory, language, or even rational thought. We’re shown how these primal sensations are integral to survival, rooted in ancient evolutionary systems dating back to fish. And we have a physical location, a small dense knot in brain stem that is 525m years old. This idea, that feelings are nature’s guiding force, is a profound shift away from the “rational control” narrative most of us have absorbed. The brain is presented as bottom up not top down. We know we take in more information that we can hope to process. <br/><br/>The argument is backed by astonishing (and tragic) examples: children born without a cortex who still display emotional consciousness; mammals engaging in maternal care and play, even when deprived of higher brain functions. It forces a rethink of what it means to be conscious and where we draw the line between instinct and awareness.<br/><br/>Constructing Consciousness<br/><br/>The free energy principle is the backbone of the book’s argument: consciousness is an emergent property of an organism’s need to maintain homeostasis. In simple terms, we need to resist entropy to survive, and feelings are the internal signals that guide us. This mechanism scales from basic survival (e.g., avoiding freezing to death) to the most abstract concepts of human life.<br/><br/>The exploration of feelings as predictions - error signals generated when reality deviates from expectation - is particularly fascinating. It reframes emotions not as irrational outbursts but as finely tuned systems designed to keep us alive. Feelings are the wellspring of consciousness. We know what we feel but not always why.  The book beautifully illustrates this with examples, from fear as a protective blessing to how emotions inform decision-making in the face of uncertainty. <br/><br/>Many of the ideas are backed up from both the other top scientists from today such as Anthony Damasio, and our long dead friends such as Sigmund Freud - who has quite the rehabilitation here. The author has consciousness evolving instead of a memory trace - it's for things where we need to learn from experience, for feeling a way through a situation. Once navigated, we look to automate and speed up the process. Drive vs reflex. Using short term memory, dealing with uncertainty is what can be called hard system 2 thinking, reasoning and intentionality. The largest errors really are our best learning opportunities! (As long as we don't die.)<br/><br/>Highlights and Surprises<br/><br/>The breadth of ideas in The Hidden Spring is staggering. The sections on the Markov blanket, which separates the “self” from the external environment, are revelatory. They describe how organisms model their surroundings and use these models to act - a process that is foundational to subjectivity.<br/><br/>The discussion of perception is equally thrilling. The brain, it turns out, is far less interested in external input than you’d think. Most of what we “see” is a predictive model, informed by past experiences and updated only when reality surprises us. The comparison to generative AI tools is apt - our minds fill in gaps with astonishing efficiency. So much of the language overlaps with AI/ML terminology such as ""weightings,"" ""confidence optimizations,"" ""corrections,"" and ""expected strength."" The book frames  the striking similarities between biological processes and artificial systems, suggesting that both operate as prediction machines adapting to minimize error. It raises fascinating questions about the potential to bridge these domains and what this means for our understanding of consciousness. <br/><br/>Practical and Ethical Implications<br/><br/>As the book shifts into the implications of its theory, it becomes both exciting and troubling. The author is trying to create consciousness in machines, creating conscious programs. Incredibly inventive but the ethical dilemmas are profound. What happens when we build machines capable of feeling? Would their suffering be our responsibility? (Yes). The book doesn’t shy away from these questions, and its answers are worrying. The number one reason why consciousness evolved is to increase the chances of survival. What is the greatest threat to any machine or program we endow with it? Us. This, maybe more than raw intelligence is increasing my pdoom. And we may do it unintentionally. <br/><br/>There’s also an unexpected practicality here. The book’s insights into how emotions and consciousness function provide tools for better living. Understanding that feelings arise from prediction errors helps frame anxiety, fear, and even joy as signals to be worked with rather than battled against.<br/><br/>A Transformative Read<br/><br/>This is first-rate science writing, deeply rooted in evidence yet unafraid to speculate. He gives an answer on ""The hard problem"" and a reason why it has not been solved (before now?). Great!<br/><br/> The prose is occasionally dense, especially on the physics! but the payoff is worth it. The book builds on How Emotions are Made, subsuming the ideas there while moving us back towards more fundamental emotions that were thrown out in that work. He states that all mammals and birds have 7 core emotions. These two seem to be the poles in the field. <br/><br/>It may not prove to be correct but The Hidden Spring has the power to spark a revolution in how we understand consciousness and emotion. It feels like the right path, it feels like explanations to consciousness have never been so close.  It’s a challenging but rewarding read - one that lingers long after you’ve turned the final page.",,,1,0

The book is a smart, funny, and dark romp through themes of ecology, evolution, philosophy, sentience, and humanity.<br/><br/>Our setting is a mysterious and barely terraformed planet where a Malthusian trap plays out with guilt stricken survivors.<br/><br/>Joining our menagerie of Human, human, AI, spider, octopus, and alien fungus minds are the corvids. <br/><br/>Our inventively framed new minds are basically advanced crows, and they brilliantly serve as both an innovative co-dependant intelligence and as a clear, prescient model for LLMs (""stochastic parrots""). The corvids demonstrate a striking similarity to LLMs in their ability to mimic understanding and generate responses. Like LLMs, they process and relay information based on patterns and memory, which raises questions about the nature of true thought and sentience. The birds form bonding pairs to form a greater whole, with one having an almost perfect memory and the other being able to problem solve through reason and analysis - separated they are reduced to crows we would recognize. Their mind is somewhere between their two brains.<br/><br/>The thought of what is sentient permeates the novel and is personified in the corvids - they insist they are not sentient. They think it would be annoying. However the AI concludes we must treat the corvids as sentient because of their careful reasoning that they are not sentient, haha :)<br/><br/>Do they think, or are they merely parroting thought itself along with great quotes from the past? The story explores whether their ability to mimic understanding represents genuine cognition or simply an advanced form of pattern recognition. This raises fascinating questions about the distinction between imitating intelligence and truly possessing it within the story's context. Is sufficiently advanced instinct/programming indistinguishable from intelligence? Do the birds think or have they evolved to a point where they solve real problems without thought? Intelligence without sentience. The newer LLMs look to be able to solve novel problems, at least to approximate reasoning. Do they think, or it it just programming? Most people have a clear answer here (""No! It's just programming""). The corvids see the AI as a very high functioning reasoning machine - not sentient. This troubles Kern, our ant-powered bad tempered AI but the deeper point posed is do humans think or is it an illusion? The corvids have an answer. One you may not like. And the reasoning one often poke at this in funny ways. <br/><br/>There are intriguing thoughts as to what exactly can be sentient and what it means if nothing is. The birds push us to think of sentient systems as opposed to sentient beings made up of non-sentient cells warning us to not be too narrow in our conception.<br/><br/>Perhaps intelligence and sentience are not obvious. We may not know it when it hits us in the face. For example, the corvids’ ability to reason and problem-solve seems indistinguishable from true intelligence, yet their insistence that they lack sentience challenges our understanding of what sentience truly is. Similarly, Kern’s existential musings on human consciousness further complicate the idea, suggesting that what we perceive as thought might merely be an elaborate simulation. Later we wade into simulation theory proper, many of the discussions here too are better than the actual scientific discourse, a sign of great fiction writing. The conclusion - that if you can't tell it does not matter, I agree with.<br/><br/>There are a few dark twists to the story.

We are mostly in the rear, in Ukraine, as the plans for mass murder and genocide are slowly enforced. This groundwork becomes essential for understanding the protagonist’s descent into unreliability and madness.<br/><br/>Littell forces the reader to wade through some tedium, as little by little the horrors increase. Our narrator is an ardent Nazi, but is cultured and civilised - at least at first. A closet sexual deviant, his personal secrets bleed out through the book. He, and many of his friends are repulsed by their work, most either do it from duty, fear or necessity based on their worldview - he wants to face the reality of war and this version of it, even though he knows it is the worst kind invited by man with normal war being ""pure"" in comparison. We are presented with good family men who fell into jobs that happened to involve murdering thousands of people, they were crushed by history, if they were born in America or Mexico they would have never had to do this ""it's not the front"" and it put bread on the table. Only some were sociopaths, more later on. <br/><br/>Shoah by Bullets<br/><br/>The book doesn’t shy away from visceral and brutal depictions of Nazi atrocities. From mass shootings to the grim realities of Stalingrad and beyond, Littell leaves nothing to the imagination. One of the most jarring aspects is the juxtaposition of bureaucratic banalities against the monstrous acts being committed. For example, he's sent to Stalingrad as punishment for not pushing for the extermination of a group of ""mountain Jews"" who converted to a form of Judaism at some time in the past, rather than being racially Jewish. His superiors needed higher extermination numbers to look good compared to their rivals in order to attain promotions. Simple (genocidal) office politics. We also get a view into the minds of those tasked with mass murder. Normal people did not like it and broke down quickly. It was outsourced to Ukrainian auxiliaries, German police or locals wherever possible. The Shoah by gas was designed partly to help with the mental issues of German soldiers. <br/><br/>Later there’s the ironically idealist prosecutor in Auschwitz, rooting out theft and the ""improper conduct"" of killing Jews that were due to die the wrong way because ""justice must be done"" -  even in a death camp. It’s absurd, chilling, and true despite being almost unbelievable, yet entirely fitting for the distorted logic of the time. <br/><br/>Unreliable and Unhinged<br/><br/>As the story progresses, particularly after being shot in Stalingrad the narrator becomes increasingly untrustworthy. By the end, I was left questioning what was real and what was the product of his fractured psyche. While the historical events and most characters remain grounded in fact, the narrator’s personal accounts blur the line between reality and delusion. Despite relatively lowly rank he directly interacts will most of the Nazi top brass - aided by his benefactor, a fictional grotesque industrialist who is too fat to walk or bathe but has a harem of hot blonde assistants. There are murders, sickness and two cartoonish investigators that take us away from the historical story. This unreliability adds an extra layer of disquiet, forcing you to constantly revaluate your perspective. <br/><br/>The sections on Himmler and Adolf Eichmann are incredibly revealing - again simply more genocidal office politics though pushing back on Hannah Arendt's ""Banality of Evil"" thesis. <br/><br/>Long and Overwhelming<br/><br/>The novel is infamously long, not just in pages but in its construction. Littell writes with sprawling sentences and dense overwhelming chapters. What’s worse - the vivid descriptions of children being murdered or the lack of paragraphs? <br/><br/>Towards the end (but still 200 pages from it) the authors speeds up noting that the readers must be getting bored. Indeed. But it did not save us from another long and weird dream-like sequence when alone in his sisters house. There are several sections like this that i found very frustrating. A shorter glimpse into a deteriorating mind would surely suffice. <br/><br/>Should you read This?<br/><br/>The Kindly Ones is not a book I’d recommend lightly. It’s a monumental work, first rate for both historical accuracy* and human psychology but also deeply unsettling and not without flaws. I feel it could have been just as powerful being 200 pages shorter without the dream sequences. Even if I accept they mirror the chaotic and horrifying subject matter. Despite this, the novel’s ability to provoke thought, discomfort, and introspection is undeniable.<br/><br/>*assuming you know what is for sure fiction. ",,,1,0

As with Rovelli’s other works, this book is always interesting, blending intellectual depth with accessible storytelling.<br/><br/>Anaximander was born in Miletus, a city in ancient Ionia (modern-day Turkey), in the 6th century BCE. He was an ancient Greek thinker who sought natural explanations for the phenomena of the universe, moving away from mythological interpretations. His ground breaking ideas laid the foundations for rationality, astronomy, geography, and conceptual tools like natural laws and theoretical postulation.<br/><br/>The World’s First Scientist?<br/><br/>We know little directly about him and his ideas. Most of our knowledge comes third hand from writings centuries later. But from that we can see his contributions represent proto-science, offering the first natural explanations for the world free of myths or gods. Some ideas, like his concept of evolution, are astonishingly advanced. He correctly states that humas must have originally came from sea creatures. Others, such as the Earth being shaped like a cylinder, are less convincing, but it is here Rovelli’s spots his key innovation - moving from the assumption of ""rock all the way down"" to ""there's nothing holding us up"". This seemingly minor insight is highlighted as a pivotal moment in human thought. It is portrayed as the first leap of science, a ""conceptual revolution"" to accept facts when presented with evidence. <br/><br/>In saying this he was overturning both he ideas of his mentor Thales, and accepted dogmatic tradition. There by introducing the critical tradition - one that deliberately seeks out and corrects mistakes a ""self correcting system"" as [b:Nexus: A Brief History of Information Networks from the Stone Age to AI|204927599|Nexus  A Brief History of Information Networks from the Stone Age to AI|Yuval Noah Harari|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1709986452l/204927599._SY75_.jpg|211894394]Yuval Noah Harari would call it. Indeed Rovelli will state that Anaximander’s most profound contribution was recognising that we can be mistaken.<br/><br/>There are many other interesting threads in this book, both ancient and modern. <br/><br/>I did not realize that the development of the Greek alphabet was a ground breaking moment in history. It was the first fully phonetic system (until Esperanto), it was designed to be read aloud without prior knowledge. This innovation made knowledge accessible, contrasting with earlier systems controlled by scribes and priests. Following the Greek Dark Ages, this open system revived learning and set the stage for broader intellectual progress.<br/><br/>A Sign of the Times<br/><br/>Democracy and science both thrive on reasoned discussion, arguments, and evidence based conclusions. They thrive in societies free from god-king myths that enable collective inquiry. Anaximander’s work would only be possible inside the thriving democratic culture he was born into. From Anaximander’s time until the fall of the Roman Republic, critical thinking spread and pushed humanity forwards, admittedly not without pushback. Once the Emperors and then Popes revived theocracy, especially under the monotheistic Christians, we were lead into the more familiar Dark Ages, an era marked by the absence of democracy and scientific advancement.<br/><br/>Science Happens in the Mind<br/><br/>Back in modern times we are presented with Science as Visionary Thought. Science begins in the mind, not with technical tools but with new ways of seeing the world. Anaximander’s perspective revealed new realms of reality. Rovelli traces this intellectual lineage through the astronomy of Copernicus and Ptolemy, then Einstein and his own work in quantum gravity. He highlights Einstein’s leap with relativity, *imagining* what it would be like riding a beam of light - while embracing prior discoveries allowing the discarding of assumed a priori truths like the simultaneity of time. Similarly, Rovelli’s research views time itself as an artifact of special conditions, following the same pattern of conceptual revolutions brining us new understandings of reality. He specifically picks out Anaximander’s methodology of uncovering ""physical laws that proceed in accordance with the order of time"" showing he hopes to overturn the very first scientists very first description of science.<br/><br/>Other Thoughts<br/><br/>This book is not just about Anaximander but the general evolution of scientific thinking and it's opposite pole, religion. Rovelli critiques modern cultural relativism, noting a paper that looked at 'western' and Chinese astronomy and thoughts about the size of the earth and distance of the sun.  Chinese thought was wrong, and when presented with Western evidence in the 16th century they changed their mind and adopted the correct view - however the paper refused to say that one was a closer approximation of reality, saying that all cultures have truth claims. I am glad he was brave enough to state how wrong this is while not slipping into anything like xenophobia - he argues that while truth may have cultural expressions, it remains grounded in objective reality. He links Chinese respect for established facts and mentors and a stagnation in scientific development. I would say this is true by the modern birth of science in the renaissance, but strikes me as false for the 1000 years beforehand. Most advances were Chinese at this time.<br/><br/>A Nicer Dawkins<br/><br/>Chapter 10 delves into the tension between religion and rationality. Anaximander’s work - the first to rationalise the universe and cosmology - raises questions about the basic necessity of religion. He marks the violent Christian destruction of the Library of Alexandria as symbolising a return to theocracy, ushering in 1,500 years of religious dominance in the West. There are some eloquent but basic arguments against religion and anti-rationalism that seem strangely out of place. <br/><br/>Fun fact - every ship that docked at Alexandria was forced, on pane of death, to hand over all books to the library to be copied, with the copied being returned to the captains. What a treasure we lost. <br/><br/>A Wild Finale<br/><br/>The final chapter is a wild meander reflection on  human thought. I thought Rovelli’s musings were verging on the psychedelic, then indeed LSD and talking to trees comes up. There's a reason why i apricate his work so deeply. Another great read, though lacking the strong narrative of his other 5 star works. <br/><br/>",,,1,0

I have gifted Sapiens more than any other book and deeply enjoyed the follow-up, Homo Deus. As a major fan of Harari’s original perspectives and bold claims on history, humanity, and the future, I was eager to see where this latest work would land.<br/><br/>Recently, it has been hard to ignore a noticeable negative vibe shift in the reception of Harari’s work. I approached this book with both curiosity and some scepticism. At its core, the book focuses on information networks—examining how the nexus of information, technology, and power has driven human development, how these networks are not always what they seem, and how artificial intelligence is poised to transform everything.<br/><br/>While packed with compelling insights and thought-provoking ideas, the book doesn’t quite reach the brilliance of the author’s earlier works. Some sections feel reheated, overly simplified, or prone to misinterpretation without prior knowledge of Harari’s perspective. Nevertheless, it remains a strong and engaging read, earning a solid 4/5 stars for its ambition and contemporary relevance.<br/><br/>The Core Ideas<br/><br/>The book examines how human cooperation relies on networks of information—and how these networks are inherently flawed. The author argues that the systems we create often predispose us to misuse them. A central tension lies in the competing purposes of information networks: creating Order and producing Truths. Harari astutely observes that those who specialise in truth (scientists and engineers) usually take orders from those who excel at enforcing order (politicians and religious leaders).<br/><br/>Telling the truth, Harari reminds us, is rarely the most effective way to motivate people.<br/>To build on these ideas, the author revisits the concept of intersubjective realities, a uniquely human construct of shared fictions that underpin societies. Nations, religions, and money exist not in the physical world but in the collective minds of people, binding them together through shared stories.<br/><br/>This concept, while central to Harari’s work, is often misunderstood. He is not claiming that entities like France are unreal; instead, he argues that their existence depends on shared human agreement. If all humans vanished tomorrow, the concept of France and the Euro would cease to exist, even though the physical buildings of Paris and the beaches of Brittany would remain. Harari distinguishes between three layers of reality: objective physical reality, subjective experience, and the uniquely human (so far) intersubjective reality that enables large-scale societies.<br/><br/>Shifting to the book’s new ideas, Harari emphasises the notion of information as connection rather than mere representation. Information does not just represent truth; it forms networks that shape and connect human experiences. For example, astrology—though scientifically invalid—continues to deeply influence culture. Its vast network of data points creates a tangible reality for millions, affecting their decisions and behaviours in meaningful ways.<br/><br/>One of the book’s most striking examples is the story of the 15th-century bestseller The Hammer of the Witches, which illustrates how information can be dangerous. Before its publication, belief in witches was limited. Afterward, a global satanic conspiracy became a widely accepted intersubjective reality. People saw witches everywhere, leading to the creation of bureaucratic systems, widespread accusations, and the torture and execution of tens of thousands of innocent men, women, and children. Harari argues that this phenomenon was not medieval but distinctly modern, driven by the emerging technology of books and the psychology of shared belief.<br/><br/>In a similar vein, Harari examines the development of modern mass democracy, which required technological advancements like mass media. However, the proliferation of information did not lead exclusively to liberal democracies; it also enabled totalitarian states. Harari explores the paradox of how greater access to information can simultaneously empower and oppress societies. From this foundation, he transitions to how artificial intelligence fundamentally changes the game.<br/><br/>Why this Matters Now<br/><br/>Totalitarian societies collapsed under the weight of centralization and information overload - the soviets could not manage the data that was fed into the ossifying system. AI systems could do so. They could easily assist a dictator keep total control over a society - they already do so in some nations. <br/><br/>The real danger is if they take over themselves of course. A single point of control is the perfect place for a malevolent AI (or one simply mis-aligned) to take control. Fractured democracies have greater protections. The thought experiments here are simple but effective. <br/><br/>A key point is keeping humans in the loop and he argues controversially that they have already been removed in some spaces. He assesses the role of Facebook’s social media algorithms in the ethnic cleansing in Myanmar in 2016. I did not find the argument fully convincing, but the gist is that the algorithm was focused on ‘driving engagement’. And that it discovered outrage did this most efficiently. So the algorithm pushed racially inflammatory videos that drove ethnic strife. No humans were in the loop. The danger is that as AI systems become more powerful and we outsource more responsibility we can’t understand what they think or why they decide. <br/><br/>The consequences could be devastating even if for benign reasons. From the printing press to artificial intelligence, technological advancements have enhanced human cooperation while simultaneously enabling control and oppression. For the first time non-human entities could create their own intersubjective realities, driving their own effects on the world. <br/><br/>Have I Changed or is the Music not as Good Anymore?<br/><br/>Although the book’s core ideas are compelling, it doesn’t achieve the depth and coherence of the author’s earlier works. Some sections feel overly simplified, such as the comparison between scientific inquiry and the institutional dogma of the Catholic Church. While the analysis is valid, highlighting the importance of self correcting mechanisms, it lacks the nuance expected from this author. <br/><br/>While I enjoyed his trademark novel views, such as when comparing religious Books to blockchain - immutable records forming sequences of accepted truths. The analogy of early Christian texts as “blocks” - some accepted, others rejected with profound outcomes for everyone alive today  is one of the book’s many clever ways of explaining abstract concepts. However, his call for a similar “AI canonization” now falls a little flat.  <br/><br/>Readers unfamiliar with the author’s worldview may also misinterpret certain arguments. For instance, the nuanced take on nationalism might be mistaken for uncritical endorsement without careful reading. Some of the wider political points are well thought out, observing that recently the left has become the protector of established institutions, while conservatives, having lost faith in these systems, have turned revolutionary - but seem a little out of place in this book.<br/><br/>Well worth reading but I find myself doing so with a more critical eye he himself helped me develop. A little like your favorite bands new stuff, usually one or two bangers on an album when it used to be all ten tracks!",,,1,0

It is WELL EARNED. I used a listen-along podcast to help me parse what was going on, and still, I was confused.<br/><br/>This is a very cool, brutal, and f**ked up world, and the author has no interest in explaining any of it to you. Steven Erikson drops you straight into the deep end - no exposition, no lore dumps, no helpful guide. You flail until you figure out how to swim. Then you drown. And, well, that’s part of the charm. It feels like you’ve wandered into something massive, like the story’s already been in motion (for about 300,000 years), and you’re just another character trying to catch up.<br/><br/>The world-building is dense, sprawling, and complex. There are gods, ascendants, other races, magic rabbit warrens, ancient conflicts, multiple continents and plots within plots, all with a 3 to 300,000-year history that you're never fully caught up on. Characters pop in and out, get renamed and reborn - one has three names in this one book. But that’s the beauty of it: it feels gritty, because real history is messy and confusing, and not everyone gets a neat backstory explanation. It’s frustrating, but it's also why the book leaves such an impression.<br/><br/>The pacing is relentless. There’s very little handholding, and when the action kicks in, it’s chaotic and violent. The magic system is another beast altogether—those rabbit warrens, Deck of Dragons cards, and weird sorcery that seems to follow its own arcane rules. I won’t pretend I understood all of it, but it felt powerful, otherworldly, and mysterious, which is maybe all it needed to be. At one point late on, someone mentions ""dragons."" Then, wow, do we get some dragons. And a vicious wizard trapped in a doll. And a magic sword that traps your soul. Nice. <br/><br/>By the end of Gardens of the Moon, I still had so many questions, but I also felt like this was just the beginning of something much larger and more ambitious. It’s not an easy read, and I totally get why some people bounce off it. But if you can embrace the confusion and just let yourself be swept along, there’s something worth exploring here. Everyone says it gets easier, and i promised book 2 at least to my introducer, <br/><br/>Would I recommend it? Only if you’re ready to work for it. It’s not a casual fantasy read—it’s a commitment.

Again it’s a brutal, unflinching, and darkly humorous book that has redefined what fantasy can be for me. This ‘grey’ world is filled with morally ambiguous characters, unpredictable twists, and gritty realism.<br/><br/>The story ties up the fates of characters we’ve come to know intimately—Logen Ninefingers, Jezal dan Luthar, and Sand dan Glokta, among others. Abercrombie doesn't let any of them off easy. Each character feels authentically flawed, and their arcs are satisfying in how little they give way to clichés. A lot happens in this book in a short space of time and pages. If this were another famous fantasy writer this could easily be an (unfinished) trilogy in itself. Jezal, our arrogant nobleman, undergoes a (telegraphed) transformation with a wicked twist that feels both believable and frustratingly human. Logen’s struggles, partly with his past, but particularly with his hyper-violent actions give him a tragic depth. And Glokta, well, the crippled torturer is perhaps the standout, walking the thin line between villainy and reluctant heroism with biting wit and sarcasm that makes him a favourite. Bayez. My man. <br/><br/>The plot twists keep coming in this final book and the payoff in the end is large, though thankfully it's never the kind of fantasy where the heroes win cleanly, or even at all, far from it. The death count of both main characters and innocents is very high. A good sign. The battles are visceral - especially in the north, and the political manoeuvring is chillingly realistic. It's not a story of good versus evil; it's a story of survival, power, and the consequences of choices made under pressure. There is but a smidgen of happiness, and it is expensively bought. <br/><br/>Abercrombie also challenges the notion of destiny and heroism throughout the book. There's a distinct sense of futility about some of the character arcs, some end up right where they started, while others face fates they’d never imagined. Some seem to end with a realistic whimper. This cynicism is part of what makes the series stand out. It won’t leave you feeling uplifted, but it definitely leaves you thinking.<br/><br/>The Last Argument of Kings is a worthy end to the trilogy - brutal, sharp, and unwilling to provide easy answers. Abercrombie’s world is harsh, but it’s also vividly realised, and it feels like every inch of the journey was worth taking, even if you come out of it feeling a bit battered. If you’re here for well-crafted characters, unpredictable narrative turns, and a fantasy that subverts traditional expectations, this book delivers in spades - on to the other in world books! <br/>",,,1,0

Norton & Company,Paperback,368,2023,2021,2024/09/05,2024/06/27,,,read,"The Man from the Future by John von Neumann<br/><br/>John von Neumann, considered by some to be the smartest man of all time, certainly lives up to the title of the biography. A pioneer across multiple fields, von Neumann made ground-breaking contributions to areas ranging from pure mathematics to nuclear weapons, digital computing, and even economics. In many ways we live in a future he envisioned. Has anyone else had a greater individual impact on modernity? His achievements certainly outweigh his fame. <br/><br/>Von Neumann’s intellect was vast, spanning disciplines outside of his mathematical homebase with ease. He made seminal contributions to pure mathematics (notably game theory), nuclear weapon design, the architecture and programming of the first digital computers, and artificial life. <br/><br/>His work continues to shape our world: 99% of the world’s computers use von Neumann architecture. Remarkably, von Neumann independently arrived at the same conclusion as his friend, Kurt Gödel, regarding his famous incompleteness theorem, quietly setting aside his work upon discovering he was second. He met and worked with the other great computer scientist of the era, Alan Turing, with it being suggested they each held half of the puzzle in their heads. Their wartime collaborations remain shrouded in mystery.<br/><br/>There are dozens of Nobel prizes and Field’s medals stories that pick up just where von Neumann left off - constantly busy with other work and interests he does not have some of the public acclaim such (overblown) prizes confer. <br/><br/>The biography tells his story a particular way, with thematic chapters focusing on one aspect of his work and somewhat ignoring the timeline. Told like this the eras overlap and work that was clearly linked seems distinct. For example his ground-breaking work in computer design and programming was explicitly to carry out H-bomb calculations; but this is separated into nuclear weapons and computing chapters. With such focus on the work, we don’t get the deepest look at the man himself. <br/><br/>We do learn of his comfortable childhood. By the age of six he could converse in ancient Greek and multiply two eight digit numbers in his head - it is said his father remained superior at this game. This comfortable life in a recently ennobled Jewish family at the apex of the Austro-Hungarian empire would be shattered by war, revolution, and racism. <br/><br/>It’s somewhat ironic that von Neumann’s father worried about the practical applications of his son’s mathematical talents and pushed him toward a more ""useful"" chemical engineering degree - passed in addition to his mathematics PhD. He would study in Germany until moving to Princeton in the early 1930s, a personification of the shifting centre for scientific and mathematical progress from central Europe to America. <br/><br/>We do learn that von Neumann’s personal life was as dynamic as his professional one. Known for his all-night soirees, a taste for hard liquor, fast cars, and smoking, he was no reclusive savant but rather the life and soul of the party.<br/><br/>It's a poignant reminder of the times that so much of von Neumann’s genius was dedicated to weapons development. He was an expert on ballistics for the US Army long before joining the Manhattan Project. Having witnessed the horrors of totalitarianism in Hungary, von Neumann strongly urged his friends (especially the Jews) to leave Europe while there was still time. It’s debatable whether it’s tragic that such brilliance was devoted to war, or fortunate that it was on the right side.<br/><br/>After World War II, von Neumann became deeply involved with the RAND Corporation, where his interests in computers, game theory, and nuclear strategy found a perfect home. He had developed game theory back in Europe, and his insights later extended far beyond games to the grim arena of thermonuclear annihilation. His work in this field outstripped even that of Nobel laureate John Nash, recognizing that humans are not purely rational agents and often cooperate. His contributions to economics with the eccentric Oskar Morgenstern, laid the foundation for modern decision theory and behavioural economics— Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman called utility theory “the most important social scientific theory ever”.<br/><br/>During this time, von Neumann also advocated for pre-emptive nuclear war against the Soviet Union, a view shared by others, including the pacifist Bertrand Russell. While hindsight allows us to see this stance as horrific, it reflects the pervasive fear of the era. By 1954, von Neumann had changed his mind; the cost, measured in hundreds of millions dead, was now too high. His influence on nuclear doctrine would be immortalized in Stanley Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove, whose titular character was partly based on him.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most relevant parts of the book for today's readers concern von Neumann's vision of computers and artificial intelligence. He foresaw the need for vast computational power and predicted that computers would become ubiquitous, integrated into everyday life—not merely rare, hyper-specialized machines. He coined the term “the singularity” and viewed the rise of artificial intelligence with more apprehension than the nuclear weapons he helped create. Yet, he believed it was a moral duty for scientists to pursue what was feasible, even if the consequences were uncertain and risky. A path most of today’s AI scientists follow.  <br/><br/>Von Neumann's role in the development of the first electronic computer, the ENIAC, was pivotal—using it to run H-bomb calculations without his colleagues' full awareness. Tragically, espionage by fellow Los Alamos scientist Klaus Fuchs around this project helped mistakenly convince the Soviets that the Americans were actively developing a H-bomb, initiating their own program.<br/><br/>The book also highlights von Neumann's second wife, Klara, who has a valid claim to being the first computer programmer having run the first modern code. This work, done months before work done by a team in Manchester was also significantly more complex. The couple also pioneered Monte Carlo randomization methods after Stanislaw Ulam brought the idea to von Neumann at Los Alamos. These are essential to modern machine learning, and exemplifies how von Neumann’s influence permeates even today’s cutting-edge technologies. The book also romantically suggests that it is named after where the lovers met, though a gambling uncle of Stanislaw takes the credit on Wikipedia. <br/><br/>Chasing increased compute (sound familiar?) von Neumann’s contributions to computing included the creation of the MANIAC, the fastest computer of its time, but his work on basic design would prove more influential. Labelled as the cornerstone of modernity, the “birth certificate of modern computers, the most influential work of all time” the simplified architecture that bears his name was not all his own work, but his report detailing it is widely recognized as seminal and original; despite the failed efforts of others involved to sue him for giving away a million dollar idea for nothing. <br/><br/>On this point our hero seems to be a big fan of what we would call “open source”. He thought it essential that the fundamentals of science and computing were shared widely, not commoditized and hidden for profit. This idealistic vision is to be applauded and has echoed down the decades to the great benefit of humanity. The debate continues today, highlighted in the current AI explosion, should such advances be in the hands of private individuals, companies, or nations? Is it sustainable for the basics like Transformer technology to be openly shared but individual models hidden and commoditized? Does this hold true at AGI levels?<br/><br/>Towards the end of his life he would be enchanted by replicators and artificial life. This biography suggests it may be his most original and insightful work—remarkably produced in his 50s, long after most mathematicians peak. His Universal Constructor concept, written out in pure logic and predating the discovery of DNA, laid the groundwork for understanding self-replication and evolution through small changes. His programs, possibly the first computer virus, would only be ran decades later once computer power increased.  <br/><br/>Just before his death from cancer, his essay “Can we survive technology” was published. In it he warns about the danger of rapidly advancing technology in a finite world. With technology having truly global impacts he doubted our ability to understand it and restrain ourselves. He presciently identified issues such as climate change and the greenhouse effect, as well as the potential and risks of geoengineering. He describes a variant of “Moore’s Law” decades before Moore. <br/><br/>The essay identifies many of the risks and issues humanity has struggled with since his death, ones that will only grow in importance in the near future (looking at you AI). He, like I, was hopeful but unconvinced we would pull through as we have done so before. He was convinced that we cannot stop the march of ideas ""for progress there is no cure"". The only possible safety is relative; “there is no panacea to avoid extinction at the hands of technology, only the human qualities: patience, flexibility, intelligence.”",,,1,0

Nassim Nicholas Taleb's ""Fooled by Randomness"" offers a provocative answer: it's often just ‘luck’. This modern classic challenges our understanding of success and failure in the financial markets and beyond.<br/><br/>Taleb, now a world-famous trader and author who well fits the 'irreverent iconoclast' label on the blurb of this book, presents a compelling thesis: randomness plays an outsized role in markets and life, far more than we typically acknowledge. <br/><br/>While many of the ideas aren't the author's, he eruditely applies them specifically to trading, weaving in witty and highbrow stories (while showing his disdain for the middle class and ‘middlebrow’ culture). Insights from psychology are particularly prominent - I think Talib was ahead of his time here. <br/><br/>I've read the excellent “Thinking, Fast and Slow” by Daniel Khaneman, who along with Amos Tversky is often mentioned here so it was no surprise for instance to read again the realistic chances of having some 'superstars' from a sample of traders even if they made bad calls on average; they got lucky, and we apply a narrative of skill over the randomness behind it. Notably, this does not discount their cleverness or hard work, these are table stakes, but the narrative of skill does not explain the results. Humans are so prone to explanation, reasons, and attribution of skill that we are blind to reality. <br/><br/>This concept has had profound implications for the financial world. The growing recognition of randomness in market outcomes has contributed to the rise in popularity of index funds, which now comprise over half of the market. Investors increasingly trust long-term market averages over more expensive ""star"" traders, though this trend may carry its own risks.<br/><br/>The book improves as it goes on. In part 2 we walk through some common human heuristics (mental shortcuts) and cognitive biases, often drawing from his own experiences. He candidly admits to falling prey to the same emotional flaws he critiques, demonstrating a self-awareness that adds credibility to his arguments. The central importance of emotion has implications far beyond trading. <br/><br/>In the final part Taleb concludes with intriguing tangents into Stoic philosophy and the benefits of embracing randomness. I enjoyed this part the most. <br/><br/>""don't complain, the only thing lady Fortuna has no control over is your behaviour""<br/><br/>He poses thought-provoking questions: Would knowing the exact time of your death improve your life? In the same vein, should movie run times be kept secret to enhance the viewing experience?<br/><br/>Taleb's cultured and abrasive prose, peppered with references to classical literature and philosophy won’t appeal to all readers. Not that this will cause him a second's distress you understand. <br/><br/>Readers familiar with Kahneman's ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" or other behavioural economics works will recognize many concepts, but their application to financial markets and his personal anecdotes offer a fresh perspective. Unlike Kahneman's more academic approach, Taleb's writing is more provocative and opinionated. Though now slightly dated. <br/><br/>""Fooled by Randomness"" is a thought-provoking read that challenges our understanding of success, skill, and chance. It's particularly valuable for those in finance or business, but its insights apply broadly to how we interpret events in our lives. the central message is powerful: ""We favour the visible, the embedded, the personal, the narrated, and the tangible; we scorn the abstract."" Recognizing this bias is the first step toward a clearer understanding of the world around us.<br/><br/>While the book's style may not suit everyone, its ideas have only gained relevance since publication. For those willing to challenge their assumptions about skill and luck, ""Fooled by Randomness"" offers a rewarding and potentially perspective-altering experience.<br/>",,,1,0

As a professor at Wharton and a respected voice in the AI community (I strongly recommend his social media presence and newsletter), Mollick brings his expertise to bear in this accessible guide for those looking to understand and leverage AI in their daily lives and work.<br/><br/>This is not a book focused on the philosophical (or possibly apocalyptic) issues that have come with the current explosion in capabilities. The book provides a grounded yet fun exploration of the practical applications of today's AI tools.<br/><br/>The Rise of AI: An Accessible History<br/><br/>Mollick kicks things off with a concise history of AI and LLMs. He paints a picture of an alien intelligence that acts more like a human than traditional software. These AI ""minds"" excel at tasks we consider quintessentially human, like writing and rhyming, but often stumble on ""machine"" tasks like arithmetic and logic. The first piece of great advice is to spend 10 hours getting to know an LLM. You'll discover their strengths, and weaknesses and quirks—like their strange affinity for the number 42.<br/><br/>Mollick’s humour is a delightful aspect of the book. Early sections juxtapose AI’s superhuman abilities with funny failures, often in rhyming sentences. One memorable example of ""jailbreaking"" ChatGPT to provide a formula for making napalm had me laughing out loud  - Yarrr matey! <br/><br/>This is followed by a brief overview of the major issues such as alignment - and why they are not the focus of this book. <br/><br/>Four Principles of Working with AI<br/><br/>The heart of the book introduces AI as a co-intelligence—a powerful tool to augment our capabilities. Backed by academic evidence Mollick presents four key principles:<br/><br/>Always Invite AI to the Table: Start by asking how AI can help with any task—you might be surprised by the results.<br/><br/>Be the Human in the Loop: AI can be an incredible co-intelligence, but it doesn’t actually know anything. They are prediction machines designed to please the user over being accurate, much like superhuman interns with zero real-world experience.<br/><br/>Treat AI Like a Person (but tell it what kind of person it is): Generic prompts get generic answers. Specify who you want the AI to emulate—an expert recruiter, Nobel-winning scientist, or four-star general—and you’ll get more tailored responses.<br/><br/>Assume This Is the Worst AI You Will Ever Use: We’re not at the top of the AI progress curve. You don’t have to subscribe to the vision of AGI or Superintelligence to accept that the tools will become more powerful, quickly. Stay open to new developments.<br/><br/>AI as a Creative, as a Coach, as a Coworker and as a Tutor<br/><br/>The following sections are useful but focused on areas where the author, an academic, has a lot of experience. This is actually an important point. A co-intelligence is best used by experts in their own fields. You are the expert in your specific field. In a more recent newsletter Mollick quipped “we are all in R&D now” indeed you are best placed to leverage the new technology in your day to day life and work, there will be surprising results. I think these ‘mundane’ uses will be the major driver in work changes short term. You will need to try yourself. Helpfully, he does provide custom GPTs to be used with ChatGPT. I found some more useful than others. A sign of things to come in publishing. <br/><br/>The Future of Work: A Balanced View<br/><br/>Worried about AI taking your job? Mollick offers a nuanced view. Yes, things will change, but it's not about replacement—it's about augmentation. AI proficiency has a jagged edge; some tasks are well-suited to AI, while others are not. Finding the right balance through testing is key. Mollick’s research supports this, showing that those who augmented their tasks with AI performed better than those who fully automated. Tasks to delegate to AI should be tedious, repetitive, and boring—though by no means unimportant or easy.<br/><br/>Practical Tips and Final Thoughts<br/><br/>There are some prompting tips—nothing new if you follow the space, but useful nonetheless. Notably there is an accurate prediction that advanced prompting will soon be automated, this is already released by Anthropic and is the focus of many GPTs. <br/><br/>While ""Co-Intelligence"" might not dive as deep as AI enthusiasts hope, it's an excellent primer for anyone looking to quickly understand and harness the power of AI today. It's like a collection of Mollick's top-tier social media posts and blog articles, all in one place. This may have been a deliberate decision to help the book stay relevant; intriguingly there is not much in direct comparisons of the major tools either as they evolve so rapidly. I would say it’s good for those who follow his work and AI closely, great for those that don’t but who are interested in upskilling quickly.",,,1,0

It worked on me!<br/><br/>For the initial two-thirds of ""Fatherland"" by Robert Harris, I was under the impression that the book merely exploited this tactic. Set in a 1960s Berlin where the Nazis have won the war and are engaged in a Cold War with the United States, the narrative unfolds as a somewhat predictable police procedural, complete with a murder investigation and an exotic love interest. The alternate reality serves more as a backdrop for a while, offering readers a glimpse into the grandiose yet horrific Berlin envisioned by Speer and Hitler, there are lots of SS uniforms and a menacing general vibe, yet it seems to add little to the plot's substance.<br/><br/>However, as the story progresses into its final third, the necessity of its setting in 1960s Berlin becomes unmistakably clear. The murder is revealed to be part of a larger, more sinister conspiracy, providing a broader commentary on life under totalitarian rule. The narrative delves into the 'banality of evil'—the idea that ordinary individuals, simply by performing their duties without question, can perpetuate immense atrocities. It prompts reflection on family dynamics, moral choices, and the potential for dissent within such regimes.<br/><br/>The protagonist, with his cynical demeanour and relentless questioning of the status quo, becomes increasingly relatable and compelling. In contrast, the love interest, though entertaining, strikes a less convincing note, bordering on caricature.<br/><br/>The book is expertly researched. You really feel you are moving round the Berlin imagined in Speer's models and Hitler's mind before it was flattened. The party members are all real party members with alternate histories. The world before the timeline splits in the early 40s is at it is for us. This was done well, it is no marketing trick. <br/><br/>To it's credit ""Fatherland"" eschews a formulaic ending, instead leaving readers to ponder the realities of life under totalitarianism and the ease with which such histories could have unfolded. This narrative serves as a poignant reminder of the thin line between our reality and a world where the truth and lives are equally disposable—a cautionary tale for contemporary society. ",,,1,0

It is distinctly McCarthy, carrying all the hallmark brutality and elegance I've come to cherish in his writing. Though the beautiful and majestic lyrical turns of later works is not quite present, the visceral horror certainly is. <br/><br/><br/>In many of his later books we have mostly 'good' people in bad situations, or meeting (very) 'bad' people; here our protagonist is straight up bad, and getting worse.   <br/><br/><br/>The story starts in a unhurried manner, potentially disguising its author were it not for the evocative depictions of the Southern landscape.

Wonderfully wrought, crisply translated. <br/><br/>Compared to his other works this has more personal stories, it is him and his student(s) as the protagonists this time, not the luminaries of Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. <br/><br/>Rovelli, with his characteristic eloquence, makes complex theoretical physics accessible, sharing insights into how the universe may not just be an assembly of black holes consuming all matter and light, but might also include white holes, where matter and light find rebirth. The book is less about providing concrete answers and more about broadening our understanding of cosmic possibilities, as it elegantly navigates through the realms of spacetime and quantum mechanics (with help from Dante!).<br/><br/>It does (in an understated manner) pose solutions to the central tension between Relativity and Quantum Mechanics - no mean feat. A little white hole here, reverse time there and poof where's the issue? :) <br/><br/>With ""White Holes,"" Rovelli continues to affirm his place as a masterful science communicator. He has a unique ability to capture the imagination with vivid descriptions while grounding discussions in the bedrock of scientific theory. His treatment of white holes as a concept challenges the reader to think beyond traditional astrophysical notions and to entertain the potential for cosmic phenomena that mirror the lifecycle of living organisms—birth, existence, and a transformative end.<br/><br/>Yet, the book is not just a theoretical treatise; it is also a contemplative reflection on human understanding and the nature of scientific inquiry. Rovelli's philosophical musings are interwoven with empirical discussions, inviting the reader to ponder on the nature of knowledge itself and our place in the universe. It is these parts of his works that I enjoy most. I will read them all. <br/>",,,1,0

Required reading for those in, or interested in the field, despite maybe not offering a huge amount of new information. Maybe not hugely interesting for those who are not. <br/><br/>In ""The Coming Wave,"" we are navigated the reader through the intricate tapestry of contemporary technological evolution, with the co-founder of DeepMind and current CEO of Inflection AI Mustafa Suleman positing that we stand on the cusp of a wave more fundamental and challenging to contain than any before – akin to a Cambrian explosion of innovation. <br/><br/>They authors assert that technology has transcended the physical realm of atoms, becoming a recombinant force, analogous to language or chemistry, that exponentially feeds on itself. In two areas, Artificial Intelligence and Synthetic Biology this will provide huge benefits while posing immense challenges for humanity. <br/><br/>The realm of AI is the the authors home field, here he describes a landscape where there's no upper limit to scaling even today, we can simply daisy chain existing chips together to shatters barriers we once deemed insurmountable. His new company released it's LLM that challenges (though not surpasses) GPT4 last month. He knows what he is talking about. He presents a modern Turing test, not of conversational indistinguishability, but of entrepreneurial autonomy: the ability to generate a million dollars in revenue on Amazon with minimal human intervention past the prompt. So the searching, API connections marketing and banking all done by the AI agent. He suggests we are on the brink (a few years) of developing this ""Artificial Capable Intelligence"" where this type of self-executing to-do list programs will be realized. Interestingly he suggests banking aspect proving the most difficult part! It's a smart way of thinking this through. <br/><br/>Suleyman and Bhaskar later delve into techno-nationalism, acknowledging the validity of concerns surrounding the global race for technological supremacy, with China as a formidable contender. They explore the dichotomy of tech and state, contemplating the amplified pace at which technology reshapes politics and society, and questioning whether this rapid evolution serves the state's interests – be it a centralised model like China's or a more cosmopolitan approach. The incentives for individuals and companies are also expertly analysed, why do people work on this? What do scientists want? Money, kudos, fame, to be the first? Yes some of all of this. Without aligning safety concerns now we could face disaster here. <br/><br/>One of the book's central themes is the democratization of power through the plummeting cost of technology, empowering individuals and eroding traditional state controls. AI and to a lesser extent Synthetic Biology are force multipliers. This supercharging of individuals, and the masses carries with it the risk of unintended consequences, as even well-intentioned actors find themselves wielding tools of unprecedented potency, particularly in the uncontrolled realm of synthetic biology. These sections are more focused on disaster, cleverly playing real life accidents to show just how easy we blunder into outbreaks and pandemics (he deliberately leaves out the Covid 19 lab leak by showing several other less controversial ones.) It is worrying. The threat is very real. <br/><br/>The authors navigate a delicate tension between heavy state control and empowered individual actors, suggesting that a single misstep or one successful attack could result in catastrophe. They argue for robust frameworks for research, safety, and disclosures, underscoring the necessity of cooperation between companies and nations. Very wise. They clearly care. <br/><br/>Suleyman, with his background at DeepMind and their acquisition by Google, brings a personal touch to the narrative, emphasizing the need for collective responsibility in a field where he himself has been a key player. He calls for a commitment from all stakeholders to navigate the ""narrow path"" that lies between the loss of control and the loss of freedom – a balance between openness and closure to avoid catastrophic outcomes. He details how hard it was to force AI safety as a key principle in a for profit company. See OpenAI for more of the same!<br/><br/>While the book offers insightful perspectives on the future role of nation-states, it could be critiqued for leaning towards pessimism regarding their enduring power. Nonetheless, ""The Coming Wave"" stands as a testament to the profound implications of our technological trajectory and the critical choices that lie ahead.",,,1,0

The scope here is vast, the terrain uneven and complicated yet we emerge with a far greater understanding of what we both know, and more clearly what we don’t regarding the journey of humanity.<br/><br/>The historical analysis is first rate, some of the best I’ve ever read. However, some of the reasoning, together with some of the<br/>authors ideas as to how, what and why things may have gone the way they did is grasping. I think some of it stems from what I see as a<br/>negative socio-political outlook of present times.<br/><br/>One of the most exciting things with reading (with learning more generally) for me is overturning ideas I already had in my mind, how something fixed I thought I knew is either based on shaky ground or is plain wrong. A huge compliment to this work is that it did this for me repeatedly. On both small and large scales.<br/><br/>The book is excellent on breaking the linear idea of development and highlighting where this originated. I have broadly absorbed this<br/>narrative despite (because?) of high-level university courses and famous books. It does not fit the evidence at small to medium time<br/>scales – the long view of history? That remains open in my view.<br/><br/>In the same vein they assess ‘technology’ as the core signifier of development & civilisation through epochs. We live in such a<br/>technology fixated age, and we may project this backwards.<br/><br/>There is plenty of evidence for technological development being invented for use in rituals, for play not for societal change. Farming<br/>of several crops itself looks geared to religious offerings in Egypt, not food for people (leading to debt  inequality). Same for pottery<br/>(figurines), mining (pigments) steam engines (cool door openings), wheels (for toys in the Americas, not carts).<br/><br/>Rather than looking into what metals people used, or what enormous monuments they left behind could we ask how happy the people were? How free to live life as they saw fit? How peaceful it was? Yes, we should. And for sure in places people where better off outside of<br/>crushing empires of coercion living in smaller tribes. Pinker has lots of data saying it would not have been so safe everywhere however! I<br/>remain unconvinced either way on the violence question, but the day tovday I take the good point made in this work.<br/><br/>We are reminded that clearly sedentary ‘civilisations’ don’t tell the whole story. The Mongols, who left little in terms of grand buildings, fought Japanese, Javanese, and Christian knights at the same time who<br/>never even knew the others existed. They too were organized, powerful, technologically advanced. Some Native Americans chose to leave civilization (settled cities/towns) and live freer in harmony with their surroundings.<br/><br/>The authors brilliantly show how modes of production are not the silver bullet either – the key transformational change highlighted by<br/>so many other writers. They provide instructive examples from a huge range of societies. Farming was clearly a choice, not a default or a<br/>trap, and its use waxed and waned across time and geography – there was no single agricultural revolution, the shift of farming to core focus took millennia. Language groups, and modern studies of the remaining hunter gatherers receive the same excellent treatment among others famous theories.<br/><br/>One of the main themes of Yuval Harrari’s Sapiens is that humans are both master storytellers (and story followers), and he succeeded in writing an amazing story for us to follow. However, maybe it was too clear, too well constructed, here the narrative follows more closely what seems to have actually happened in the deep past, it’s stop<br/>start, here and there, not quite neat and coherent but always insightful.<br/><br/>The authors specifically call out two of my favourite writers/books for criticism – Pinker’s The Better Angles of our Nature and the<br/>above-mentioned Sapiens. The criticisms are fairly minor, stating they make large assumptions that the evidence does not back up, even when they state this themselves. Fair enough, though hilariously they do<br/>the exact same thing here, repeatedly assuming the current world is falling to pieces around us when the evidence points the other way on almost every metric (environmental being the only real, but very important outlier). I feel their political persuasions shine through<br/>here, rather than the evidence. Are we ‘stuck’ unable to imagine other social worlds? I’m not convinced. This is a small part of the book,<br/>more concerned with how to change or what to do, it is weaker than the main body, where they analyse, and teardown established history<br/>brilliantly.<br/><br/>A huge portion of the book focuses on Freedom, it is most interesting. It centres mostly on some Native American tribes and the major voices of the European Enlightenment – Rousseau in particular (for a book that claims to not talk about him he comes up a lot!). The idea is that the Native Americans had a better conception of freedom compared to the Europeans, a true personal freedom with no fixed kings or duty<br/>– and that they commonly and openly laughed at the Europeans.<br/><br/>Furthermore, that from this exchange key Enlightenment ideas took hold back in Europe, Democracy, rights, actual Freedoms. There is plenty of evidence for this, Europeans (past and present) apparently refused to believe the ‘savages’ even in print. This section was very insightful, if theory heavy, though I would caution that it is not quite a<br/>knockout blow.<br/><br/>There is a lengthy section on a theory of civilisations rising in opposition to what is next to them. This neatly explains a slavery<br/>conundrum in the Pacific Northwest. But I am unsure how well it fits globally. It is used to explain the seemingly huge change from the<br/>original egalitarian civilisations to ones dominated by heroic warrior (then monarchic) elites. Bringing with it dreaded inequality. This<br/>could be true, al least in places. But as to why this happened almost everywhere the authors run out of explanations, we seem to have<br/>collectively forgotten it could be done another way and acquiesced into near slavery.<br/><br/>The work on States is excellent. When scholars talk of 'states' in the past, these are nothing more than projections of what we have now. They would not make sense to the people at the time. Today it's based<br/>on 3 elements, sovereignty (and a monopoly of violence), administration and competitive politics. They exist together now but<br/>this is unusual.<br/><br/>There are very interesting sections regarding feminism. They speculate how the world before the warrior elites may have been feminist led. Intriguing but evidence light, maybe led by their politics. There is<br/>more evidence for it in the Minoan civilisation. Again, just not quite enough for a knockout blow just yet.<br/><br/>As mentioned above, they challenge the conception of violence as a core part of humanity, suggesting it may have been pushed or invented as such later. This is in direct opposition to Pinker, and indeed my<br/>beloved Cormac Macarthy. Can it be true? It is possible, in some places and times I’m onboard. Everywhere? Most of the time…ah I can’t quite accept it. Do states promote warfare as opposed to limiting it?<br/>Do rankings (status games) promote conflict? Very possibly. Can humans actually life outside of these games…unknown. Probably more so than today at least.<br/><br/>There is so much more, it's easier to tear down than to build, but nevertheless a great, thoughtful read!",,,1,0

Shuggie's misplaced (?) love for his alcoholic mother Agnes the only beauty here (apart from the writing itself). <br/><br/>The work is actually mostly focused on Agnes not Shuggie, told often but not exclusively through his eyes. The supporting cast have interesting tales too, the section on Agnes' parents during the war in particular stood out. <br/><br/>The structure of the book helps it hit hard, we are spoonfed the backstory as we decend deeper into drink-fuelled misery. Like ""Requiem for a dream"" with Special Brew replacing the heroin. <br/><br/>While I don't understand the depths of alcohol addiction, I can't understand the seeming need for the women of the book to bag a man, any man. Even if jobless, disgusting, abusive, a rapist...still Agnes and others place such value in having (or keeping) one. Maybe it is part of a status game, because it's not simply financial, but wow, play another game lassies, they are no good for ye. <br/><br/>The book is very Scottish, very Glaswiegen actually, it will sound better in your head if you know a Glaswiegen in real life!<br/><br/>I doubt it is a point of the novel, but the bleak view of 80s Thatcherite Glasgow actually made me come around to some right wing views (not easy to say coming from a Labour heartland part of the country!). I'm sure more could have been done to retrain miners & greatly improve schooling for instance, but it seems the residents of Pithead could have helped themselves too. The deep rooted, multi-generational reliance on benefits that were good enough to get by on forms part of the hellish poverty trap. We see Leek & Cath both moving away to escape it successfully. <br/><br/>Glasgow, like the much closer to me Liverpool, is much improved today. Though both still have entrenched areas of extreme deprivation, resulting in the lowest life expectancies in the UK (around 55, lower than most sub-Saharan African countries). Lack of education, later work, and terrible general health indicators driven by smoking and drinking compound. It's a tough problem, just throwing money at the issue won't solve it, though it will help. Recent research from the US seems to show a deep scarring for those who suffer during recessions - many people fail to recover and slip into despondency & dependency (alcohol and later heroin in 80s Glasgow, Oxycodone then heroin & fentanyl since 2008 in the US). There must be ways to target the high risk groups for positive intervention. <br/><br/>I've read that the story is semi-autobiographical, that many of the events happened to the author though not the whole story, ouch what an upbringing - amazing he has went on to achieve so much in several fields.

Storr's exploration is both impressive and informative, leaving readers with a deep understanding of (at least one) the underlying forces that shape our actions and decisions.<br/><br/>At the heart of the book lies a compelling central thesis: humans are engaged in a perpetual game of status, where the primary objective is to ascend the social hierarchy and importantly, avoid being at the bottom. Storr expertly demonstrates how this game manifests itself in various contexts, influencing both individual behavior and the dynamics of societies. From ancient civilizations to modern-day cultures, the pursuit of status emerges as a constant driving force, impacting our lives in profound ways.<br/><br/>One of the book's key insights revolves around the significance of relative status over absolute status. Storr highlights that while money and power might lose their allure once enough is attained, the pursuit of higher social standing knows no bounds. Billionaires don't stop playing once they get rich! This captivating notion sheds light on the motivations behind some of humanity's most remarkable achievements and, conversely, its most devastating disasters.<br/><br/>The book has a good section on the changes made by the church in Europe in the middle ages concerning marriage & inhertance. I have read before on the immese (and unintended) cosenquences of the huge efforts to stop people having a jolly good time with thier first cousins. The church wanted more money, so it chsnged the status game; it spawned a new society based on the family unit (vs clans) and provided the inpetus for huge ecomonic and social upheval.<br/><br/>""The Status Game"" also delves into the biological and psychological ramifications of low status, revealing how it can lead to adverse health effects, mainly through stress and inflammatory responses. These may be impacted via diet & poverty, intertwined but seperate causes. <br/><br/>Through insightful examples, Storr demonstrates the intertwining of status with moral judgments and how individuals may justify morally questionable acts within the context of their particular status game. Some of the examples are extreme, a tactic i like! But expect to read about normalized, in fact encouraged, child abuse. And not only in the past. <br/><br/>Here in the present, the book shines a light on the powerful influence of social media and cults, both of which capitalize on the human need for connection and status. Storr explores how those who fail to succeed in mainstream societal status games may seek solace and recognition in smaller, alternative subcultures. You may be out of one game but will soon join another. <br/><br/>Storr's analysis of the impact of status on recent historical events, such as Trump's rise to power and the Brexit phenomenon, is particularly enlightening. He convincingly argues that relative status plays a pivotal role in shaping political landscapes and public opinion. It was many in the 'lower classes' who felt their relative decline compared to those around them, even if in absloute ecomonic terms their circumstances had improved that voted for a hard change.<br/><br/>Throughout the book, Storr delves into the lives of infamous figures, particulary Lenin and Stalin, revealing how personal humiliations and losses of status drove these individuals to seek power and influence, with disastrous consequences for millions. Insightful yet this is not the whole story. I really felt the overeach in sections like this, with the author hammering home the books key theme with abandon, missing some heavy duty historical rivets. <br/><br/>One of the book's significant takeaways is the assertion that equality is an impossible dream. Storr contends that the desire for status and social recognition is innate, making it a fundamental aspect of human nature. However, he wisely acknowledges that through acknowledging this aspect of ourselves and striving for a balanced understanding of human motivations we can be happier. This syncs well with how I responed to a professor's question back in university 'if we had unimited stuff, everything in abudabce for all, would humans still be in conflict?"" Yes i think so!<br/><br/>At times i feel the authour shows his journalistic background, a clumsy at best use of statistics at one point and a glossing over of alternate hypothosis that would not have gone down well in an academic book, but these are minor blemishes on a very good book. <br/><br/>""The Status Game"" concludes with a thought-provoking proposition: the purpose of life is not to win the status game but to play it. Storr encourages readers to embrace the game as an integral part of the human experience, and in doing so, find a greater sense of fulfillment and purpose.<br/><br/>Review in conjunction with chatGTP :)",,,1,0

I had high expectations as the authors reputation, the ratings, and the subject matter all pointed towards a sure fire hit. It's by no means terrible, but it is wooden, formulaic and unbelievable. <br/><br/>I love sprawling historical fiction, complicated multi year and multi level stories. War & Peace, Life & Fate, Wolf Hall and more pulpy books such as the Conquer series. All rated 5*. <br/><br/>I had anticipated something close to the true classics of the genre, given the standing ""The Pillars of the Earth"" is held in. It's nowhere near them.<br/><br/>We do have sprawling settings, but a comically small number of characters that combine and recombine to a ridiculous degree. One of the set, often two, must be present at all major historical plot points, it becomes quite silly. Why not just have some more characters? <br/><br/>The characters themselves are infact avatars of their stereotyped class per country. Evil capitalists, toffs, up an coming socialists bla bla. They often become the mouth peace for generic historical anslysis - words that people would never use in actual conversations. The history itself may not be wholly inaccurate but it for sure lacks nuance. A better book may have assumed greater reader intelligence to read between the lines. <br/><br/>On the positive side when the characters are allowed to be normal they do have a charm, I did get a keen sense of both the places and times described. The hardships and food of pre war coal miners for example, or what the life of unmarried mother's was like. <br/><br/>Another positive is the highlighting of little know historical footnotes, the Allied assistance of the White Russians here is well covered though again contains a silly confluence of characters. <br/><br/>The best scene, in Wales some weeks after the first day of the battle of the Somme is fantastic.

I am unsure if it matters to either story. <br/><br/>That said some of the tangents and thoughts are facinsting. Again he slips in a lot from his outstanding essay 'the Kerkule problem'. https://nautil.us/the-kekul-problem-236574/<br/><br/>For example Alicia positing language as a parasite - with the (millions of years older) unconscious being totally unready for it, struggling to adapt to such a powerful force that evolved from no know need. And apparently bringing with it endless war (reminiscent if the Judge from Blood Meridian), and madness itself - there can't be madness without language, as how would the voices in your head talk to you?? Haha.<br/><br/>Should be read by all those that read ""The Passenger"" though they should not expect answers to all the questions posed there, and maybe not by so many others...",,,1,0

Also a hot mess. I don't think I would recommend this as a first McCarthy book, but it's a tour de force - a rehashing of many elements from his previous books multiplied by a new, cosmic constant of darkness. <br/><br/>The darkness, or truth, is always there in his previous works - allowing for the chinks of light he lets slip through. Here via quantum physics, pure mathematics and the atomic bomb it receives a Universal upgrade. <br/><br/>""We are flawed at our core that is what we know. We loath ourselves insufficient to our deserts. So how bad is the world ? How bad? The world's truth constitutes a vision so terrifying as to beggar the prophecies of the bleakest seer who ever walked it. Once you accept that then the idea that one day all of this will be ground to powder and blow into the void becomes not a prophecy but a promise... When it's all gone, for whom will this be a tragedy?"" What a question. <br/><br/>The book starts of as a mystery, a thriller. Yet this gradually falls away if the face of a tragic love story speckled with some of his interests. <br/><br/>McCarthy is 89, and this book has been in the works for decades. It feels like he's putting it all down one last time. All his learning about science from the Santa Fe institute, the conspiracies he's heard, the research he has done, his (insightful and brilliant) thoughts about the subconscious. <br/><br/>But not all of the elements of the book fit. For example (the author) seems to have thoughts on the Vietnam war and the JFK assassination so they are shoehorned into bar conversations. They are super interesting, but have little if anything to do with the plot - I mean, you could say the same for so much of the book! But the maths & physics stuff has a much clearer literary position within the story, embodied by the doomed brother & sister. <br/><br/>That said, if you don't like hanging threads don't read this book, I will immediately read Stella Maris, the companion 'coda' book with much more of the sister, but I do not expect the multiple complicated equations that stand in for plot to be solved there! Maybe one big one would be nice, there's scope for that at least!<br/><br/>McCarthy is not know for writing funny books, yet here I genuinely laughed out loud several times, especially with Alicia, the paranoid schizophrenic sister and her 'cohorts', but also with some of Bobby's friends.<br/><br/>There are a few chinks of light, reasons or instances of goodness, once Bobby calling out God because of beauty, and his Nana insisting that you need to believe in some form of goodness as you can't live a good life without doing so. This a little like taking joy, meaning, and even 'god' in the small things, like Camus and his coffee. Maybe it is not universal, cosmic, provable by mathematics - but it can provide solace, meaning, and joy. <br/><br/>There are practical snippets and insights into human nature - ""Suffering is a part of the human condition and must be borne. But misery is a choice.""<br/><br/>""Grief is the stuff of life. A life without grief is no life at all. But regret is a prison. Some part of you which you deeply value lies forever impaled at a crossroads you can no longer find and never forget"" <br/><br/>""don't know. I think there are times when you’d just like to get it over with. I think a lot of people would elect to be dead if they didn't have to die.""<br/><br/>And there are deeper sections. McCarthy has history of going off-piste in the final chapter- in a good way. See Blood Meridian and the Border trilogy. Here he really outdoes himself. There are epic sections of literature/philosophy (see above and below) and the prose becomes full blown cosmic poetry. In some of his earlier works you only get this in parts, he makes you work for it, but it is present throughout here, just turned up to 11 towards the end. <br/><br/>""Trudging the shingles of the universe, his thin shoulders turned to the stellar winds and the suck of alien moons dark as stones. A lonely shoreloper hurrying against the night, small and friendless and brave.""<br/><br/>""God’s own mudlark trudging cloaked and muttering the barren selvage of some nameless desolation where the cold sidereal sea breaks and seethes and the storms howl in from out of that black and heaving alcahest.""<br/><br/>""In the beginning always was nothing. The novae exploding silently. In total darkness. The stars, the passing comets. Everything at best of alleged being. Black fires. Like the fires of hell. Silence. Nothingness. Night. Black Suns herding the planets through a universe where the concept of space was meaningless for want of any end to it. For want of any concept to stand it against""<br/><br/>""God was not interested in our theology, only our silence"" <br/><br/>""His father. Who had created out of the absolute dust of the earth an evil sun by whose light men saw like some hideous adumbration of their own ends through cloth and flesh the bones in one another’s bodies.""<br/><br/>""Dead friend. the ground we walk is less of our choosing than we imagine"" - indeed, and McCarthy has such a knack of bringing that into focus, the grand proclamations and promises of doom, contrasted with he beauty of the landscapes, the vivid pain, feeling and hope of his creatures, all of us.",,,1,0

Norton Company,Hardcover,278,2021,2021,2022/11/10,2022/10/23,,,read,"4.5*<br/><br/>I read this excellent book based on the immense strength of his previous work ""The Overstory"" (https://www.goodreads.com/review/edit/40180098) - I've seen it described as a type of indirect sequel or companion book, and I can see why that has been said. <br/><br/>I would cast it as dark near future sci-fi built around a truly touching father & son story. <br/><br/>The sci-fi element is inventive, well thought out and tragic. The father & son story, based on deep loss and the immense difficulties of the son's 'neuro-divergence' (the father refutes the 'autism/on the spectrum' labels) is brilliant. <br/><br/>This relationship serves as a vehicle for damming facts and realities about the real world over-medicalisation of children and our growing list of environmental calamities. <br/><br/>The sections in nature are wonderful, following on from ""The Overstory"" as are the speculative descriptions of the many exo-planets we visit during the story. This step up from Earth into space (a little like ""The Passenger"" by Cormac McCarthy) is well received by this reader, a cosmic view on life, the universe and our place in it. The possible solutions to Fermi's paradox are dark, but not McCarthy dark! <br/><br/>My only slight issue with the book is a kind of cartoonish political situation that develops during the second half of the work. I say cartoonish, but several elements have kind of taken place in the US already. Strongmen, refusal to accept election results, science bashing, the growing power of religious extremists...well, he may be on to something, but it's not presented subtilty. A loud warning that may seem out of place with  the rest of the book in a few years - hopefully.<br/><br/>The name of the book seems to be from this section ""Only pure bewilderment kept us from civil war"" I thought this was strange as so much of the book concentrated on the father and son getting back to nature (as we all should!), and the wonder and tragedy found there, maybe it's a dual meaning.  <br/><br/>For me, the book was reminiscent of Kazuo Ishiguro's ""Never Let Me Go""  (https://www.goodreads.com/review/edit/6334) except the excitement and quality of the writing is clearly better than the Nobel prize winners book.

There is simply so much time beyond it, and we keep on pushing back key milestones. <br/><br/>Cleopatra, of Julius Ceaser and Mark Anthony fame is closer to the iPhone than to the construction of the Great Pyramid. That is not so far from the beginning of written history. Yet it is not close to the key migrations of Homo Sapiens that would replace those that where there before, of both sapien and our cousin species. So many lives, so much hardship and tenacity to survive and thrive through eons.<br/> <br/>The author is a true expert, and is clearly passionate about the subject. She goes all out here, and if you get one chance to write a popular science book about your passion why not? The science is explained clearly and from a position of authority. The story of the discoveries and the history of the area is covered well too. She is very much about changing the perception from bulky inbred dullards to successful inventive people. She mostly succeeds. <br/><br/>The book is structured with the more prosaic chapters up front, you will learn a lot about stones. Only towards the end will you learn of the headline grabbing juicy subjects, cannibalism? Inbreeding? Cross-species breeding? Extinction? yep, nice. Like Game of thrones in the stone age! I think she wanted to get across the life, death, and art sections before the sensational stuff that often pulls people in, fair enough, though they were the best ones ! <br/><br/>Neandertals really were successful, for eons across a huge range. They were inventive and tenacious. They had complex technologies. But small societies. Inbreeding was clearly common. They may have had art. It is not clear to me that this is a fact. The comparison to Homo sapien art from the same times is truly striking. Different league. <br/><br/>The cross species breeding is an incredible story. The insights from genetics is profound, winning a deserved Nobel Prize this year. The story of the Neandertal (and early sapien populations) extinctions is tantalisingly unfinished. We can't say why. But we all suspect the real reason, at least to an extent, we killed them all. I wonder if in the later waves of sapiens there was a change, maybe genetic, maybe cultural, to never stop. To not live in harmony but to exploit. The later waves did not interbreed, they replaced. It seems to me they drove extinctions. We still are. (As mentioned in ""The Sixth Extinction""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17910054-the-sixth-extinction)<br/><br/>The book is a little overwritten at times (I rolled my eyes a few times), and the truly poetic epigraphs wont be for everyone. The Neandertal cheerleading is loudest at the beginning, asserting that they were less violent than Sapiens, and that they were ""master geologists"" (for moving some stones a few k's) and the ""first archaeologists"" (for digging up parts of a cave). Though it is more measured when looking into the art and extinction possibilities later on. It would have been easy to make wild claims there. Some of the language remains technical, and a bit ridiculous to lay readers - so much talk of ""techno-complexes"" that all I could see were Neandertals gurning and pre-historic clubs!  <br/><br/>Overall I strongly recommend this book for anyone interested in Neandertals or deep hominin history!",,,1,0

No? What about if we add NAZIs?? Still no? What a weirdo.  <br/><br/>I can't believe I waited so long to read this one. It is much praised and rightly so, both as an standout study of economic history but also one that highlighted gaps and misunderstandings in mainstream history of the period. <br/><br/>I learned so much, in typical Tooze style both from standout one liners (both East and West Germany paid more in reparations than the Weimar republic ever did), and from complex thoughts that take pages to articulate. I thoroughly recommend his newsletter ""Chartbook"" for more each week, the 'One's and Tooze' podcast for a lighter version as well. <br/><br/>One of the larger points is how Hitler's vision and implementation of his plans can be framed as a rational response to the economic rise of America. A country often missed from other analyses - Hitler wanted 'living space' for the German people to build a market large enough to compete with the American colossus, and to a lesser extent the British Empire, who's living standards so outshone those of Germany. He knew time was not on his side, and he knew how those Empires were took - violently. He saw one last chance for the German people to join the top table, or face obliteration because of his insane, driving-force conviction of a global Jewish conspiracy. <br/><br/>His belief in this, so openly stated and acted upon by all the top NAZIs for decades, is also often overlooked. I did not know about Hitler's so called 'Second Book', a collection of speeches and thoughts expanding on the American question. This is happening today with Putin and Ukraine. Putin too has written and spoken his thoughts openly, then acted upon them. Both are wrong, both have wrought terrible wars and destruction.  <br/><br/>The belief also rationalizes (to an extent) the craziest decisions, the decision to invade his erstwhile ally the Soviet Union while stretched in the West (a ""adolescent, belated and perverse outgrowth of an as yet unknown obsolete European colonial settlement and expansion model""), the decision to declare war on the US (he considered it war already, economically it was) and the decision to both start the Holocaust (there where many 'reasons'!) and then to continue it when faced with acute manpower issues (political overruling the practical). They are all framed as part of the same global Jewish conspiracy. <br/><br/>Given the economic situation it is no small miracle (and a huge tragedy) that the NAZI's were able to grab power, kept it, start winning and then kept going despite the enormous economic odds. The book really illuminates the early years - with the German leadership (Strassman in particular)  trying to play the US off against the European rivals - it so nearly worked. There was indeed room for all at the top, and violence was not the only route. There were many times in the early NAZI years economic impacts could have toppled the regime. Steven Pinker in the excellent ""The Better Angles of our Nature"" notes just how 'unlucky' the world was to end up with Hitler, how so much of that conflict seems to rest with him in particular. This only adds to the case. The going can be a little slow in the early chapters as the war is many years away, but it's all very relevant. The pace picks up as the build up and war come, Tooze does a great job in staying focused on the economic side, it would be so easy to stray into the war itself - you get enough but for a full breakdown you should look elsewhere, Anthony Beevor's ""The second World War"" is excellent https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13528287-the-second-world-war?ref=nav_sb_ss_3_20. <br/><br/>The myths of German armed forces superiority are also rendered clearly. They did have some outstanding hardware (though often from later in the war) yet the Blitzkrieg tactics and wider strategy were used almost by accident - and executed with the assistance of drug fuelled (though excellent) troops. Much more detail on this in the great ""Blitzed"" by Normal Ohler https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29429893-blitzed?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=tYicHSe8M6&rank=2<br/>While the Americans were going nuclear most of the German army walked into Russia with horses dragging their gear not unlike Napoleon's Grande Army. By the time they modernized it was thankfully far too late, the crushing weight of the allied powers destroying their ability to wage war.<br/><br/>Albert Speer receives a well deserved and evidence based character assassination. He seems to have got away with what should have been a simple and clear death penalty. His image is indeed cleaner than it should be - driven by a late repudiation of the whole NAZI party and best selling, self-serving memoir. There is simply immense blood on his hands. His economic 'miracles' as also brilliantly refuted. <br/><br/>First rate book, essential for those deeply interested in the period. ",,,1,0

This one brought to you, one way or another, by humanity. <br/><br/>I have read some of the author's excellent work over the years, and this is of the same high standard. Accessable, personable (breezy!) yet impeccably researched and well presented. She's funny too ""then in its crazy, circus-like complexity the ant-bird-butterfly parade was actually a figure for the Amazon's stability. Only in a place where the rules of the game remain fixed is there time for butterflys to evolve to feed on the shit of birds that evolved to follow ants"".  <br/><br/>The book is equally strong in the history, science, and history of science sections. It is wonderfully structured to tell the stories of previous mass extinctions and this one through individual spiecies and the researchers doing the work. This takes her to some wonderful places, the great barrier reef, several tropical jungles - nice work if you can get it... though the piles of bat carcasses temper that thought! <br/><br/>I was struck by how the small species like moss or fungi can wreak total havoc, same with small changes to sensitive systems like ocean PH.<br/><br/>I was also impressed by the pushing back of the beginning of the anthropcene to our elimination of megafauna - this caused major vegitation changes to entire ecosystems. There are some insightful thoughts around a 'Faustian gene' a genetic driver that causes us to simply ""never stop"" it is ridiculous yet wonderous that we have reached a point where we spend so much time and effort in an attempt to colonise Mars. The (sometimes unintended) consequences of this impulse spell disaster for this planet. <br/><br/>I was most moved by the final plight of the Great Auk. The last ever pair vainly trying to waddle away before being strangled to death for some Victorian twats collection. Horrific. It's so easy to hate humanity, makes me want to join the ETO from ""The Three Body Problem"". <br/><br/>We have a major issue calculating 'value'. Our works of art are not priceless they are pigments on canvass, the genetic diversity of life so easily wiped out for a pittance are the real masterpieces. <br/><br/>I was a little worried about the book being slightly out of date, however it stands the test of time with apblom. Some of the finer scientific deatils were, and still are unknown, the major conclusions all totally valid. Some of this stems from the author's presentation of some seemingly obvious points, her endeavour to seek out alternate explanations and to not simply spell out doom is appriciated by this reader.

18386,The Death of Ivan Ilych,Leo Tolstoy,"Tolstoy, Leo","Aylmer Maude, Louise Maude","=""""","=""""",5,4.14,Waking Lion Press,Paperback,86,2006,1886,2022/07/17,2022/07/12,,,read,"They Put the Wrong Russian Author in my Existentialism Classes<br/><br/>I used to think Tolstoy was my favourite writer but I've not read nearly enough of his work to say that. I can say he's my favourite Russian writer. And I can say that I think this is an existentialist masterpiece, surpassing the acclaim given to Dostoevsky in that regard. <br/><br/>Ivan displays a perfect lack of authenticity, falling through his superficial life. He acts his part in society, he even acts it well, using his life and trials to obscure deeper realities and more important questions. He has fun sure, and struggles hard like many to do what is expected of him. Yet Ivan purposefully avoids the fact of his death until it imposes itself upon him, evading the key question ""there is no explanation, agony, death .... what for?"" until the bitter, lonely end. 'We must all face death alone' yet maybe we can do that better prepared, with greater compassion and grace.   <br/><br/>Ivan lives selfishly and shallowly until a final act of compassion for his family, maybe the only one he ever makes. He takes the sacrament to help his wife's suffering not his own, and recognises the love of his boy, feels his sorrow for him, knowing that it is better that he dies now for them. This act for others not himself actually eases his passing, in mind if not in body.<br/><br/>The avoidance of the fact of your death, a ubiquitous modern mindset, or being-unto-death as Heidegger may term it, is displayed by Ivan, but even more concretely by his acquaintance Peter Ivanovich. Peter, after a terrifying few moments contemplating that this may happen to him, consoles himself with the fact that it happened to Ivan and that he has no need to worry, immediately switching back to mundane everyday thoughts. This rationalisation and repression is played out for Ivan over the months of his impending doom, he knows yet he searches for cures, always avoiding the facts and not acting to change his life in a meaningful way.<br/><br/>It is maybe here that some people lose Tolstoy. I can see the argument for the importance of (some) Christian ideals in his work, living for others, especially the ones you love and finding a higher purpose. These ideals need not be Christian in my mind, Meaning being created by humans and their social relations. Indeed, modern secular science has decent evidence that living for others, having a purpose and strong social connections are all clear predictors of longevity - it is good for us physically not just spiritually as Tolstoy is driving at here. They could be directly linked of course. I think Tolstoy can be read ambiguously here, spirituality is more personal and more universal than religion in my mind. <br/><br/>There are also wonderful studies of how psychedelic assisted therapy for terminally ill patients eases passing. The key drivers are a connectedness with a larger universe, and a deeper sense of meaning for their lives. We should remember, we are all born terminally ill. Ivan made only superficial connections even with his family, and his life's meaning was transparently meaningless to him before his end, wasted chasing 'trifles'. <br/><br/>It's Tolstoy, so there are moments of brilliant writing, one section riffing of Newton's laws of gravitation but in relation to death ""an inverse ratio to the square to the distance of death' when describing the feeling of life passing faster an faster jumped out at me. I have felt that even at my 36 years. Modern science can even measure it. <br/><br/>I immediately went to read Dostoevsky, only 'Notes from Underground' - not the ideal companion piece to this. But I can't shake the feeling that Tolstoy towers over him. Not just for the grand works, but even in more modernist novellas like this. https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4846517333?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1<br/><br/>Oh one last thing, so short!

""I'm glad that I feel repulsive to her, I like that "".<br/><br/>While clearly educated, he is not well adjusted to society. That may be the first point, mass education and even widespread wealth wont create utopia. Point well taken, we will always have twats. <br/><br/>He is petty, vindictive and self obsessed. Hard to argue that this is not a widespread phenomenon in wider society today, with young men in particular. It can be a serious issue. Though I do need to add, he does not seem to go far beyond that, he's a bit of a twat, to his 'friends', a prostitute and his servant, but this is not a monster. He is not an incel with an AR15. Maybe that's a good thing. <br/><br/>The essay has some striking points ""it's the civilised gentlemen that are the most subtle destructive slaughterers, more devastating than your Atilla's... just more bland, ordinary and familiar"". So true, the most dangerous people alive wear smartly tailored suits and carry briefcases, not axe's, a point also made in ""Sapiens"" by Youval Harari. Civilisation, according to the underground man just sanitises the more bloodthirsty aspects of humanity, frowning upon acts that were once purging and cleansing. Reason (and science) are not saving us from our more base, imperfect nature. Not fully no, even 150 years later, but its hard to argue its not getting better in the aggregate. <br/><br/>He goes on to argue that man wants independence and freedom, that he needs to feel it or become just an organ, yet if freed will run right back to being told what to do, very Nietzsche. You can see why this is added to philosophy classes. The lines on free will may be in direct dialog with Tolstoy's essay at the end of War and Peace, but I can't remember it right now. The tension between what we feel, need to feel, and what science says have not moved on much since this was written. Comfort in self deception. <br/><br/>Consciousness for the underground man is 'infinitely superior"" to 2+2 = 4 (complete knowledge) as once you have maths it's just done, a fact. But with awareness and ambiguity you can ""flog yourself to wake you up, corporal punishment is better than nothing!"" haha so Russian. <br/><br/>We have a deliberate ""Anti-hero"" i am unsure if Dostoevsky coined that term, but it is meant in the truest sense here. He says it can't be a novel as he is the opposite of what a novel needs. I feel the team is watered down today, 'slightly darker hero' would be better- we feel for and love the typical anti-hero, think Tony Soprano or Walter White. They have aspects to like, Underground man does not. <br/> <br/>On ""The Death of Iva Ilych"" we have some parallels - both men drift through life inauthentically scrambling through the everyday human 'noise' not thinking on what really matters. Underground man slips much further into self pity and neurotic behaviour, he's worse and has no redemption in the story. But I am unsure if it affects anyone else in any serious way as he has no family and has retreated from society. As mentioned he is rude and mean, yet contradictory. He may inspire the prostitute to leave the profession, cruelly spelling out a dark path and admitting ""I came to you as I was treated badly, to do do the same to you to show my power"" yet it may have a positive overall result, we don't know. <br/><br/>Underground man says towards the end ""we all all divorced from real life, we are all cripples, more or less"" so divorced from real life as we are almost loathing to look at it, seeing it better in books, or online today. This is the same issue Ivan feels, seen through a grimier lens. It rings true. <br/><br/>Overall this work has some great philosophical points, mostly early on or right at the end. The story is quite aimless, and underground man is, while quite modern and prescient, not as bad as he is often portrayed. He's just a twat. I did not enjoy my time with him, less so than my first read, but I suspect that's intended. Maybe we all have a little of him in us, and there are for sure many of them about, but life can go on and progress spiritually and practically if we work at it.  ",,,1,0

The author succinctly explains the decisions made to make the book both accessible to lay people, and accurate to the new data. The recent breakthroughs in understanding the Nahuatl language spoken at the time are the bedrock of the 'new' history. It's a story written by the the locals, some of whom were there at the time of contact with the Spanish, or were directly told by people who were. It is a new point of view, lost in plain sight for centuries. This is combined with the oral histories of their peoples written down at the same time. <br/><br/>She creates a strong narrative from this data. It stays true to its point of view, not becoming a tale of Cortez or the Spanish once their writings become accessible - they are used as condiments not the main dish. I was left saying ""but what happened to Cortez!?"" at one point, slipping back into the traditional story, missing a lot of the point. We have the history of the Mexica, mostly shared myth, then their better documented rise from wandering warriors for hire to top of the local system, ruling from their impressive self built capital city Tenochtitlan.<br/><br/>The complex local system is well explained and provides many answers to question about how a few hundred Spaniards were able to wreak such havoc. Firstly, they had a lot of help from the enemies of the Mexica. Both other clans, and some crucial individuals, non more so than Malintzin/Malinche Cortez's interpreter, later lover, and famed Mexican 'traitor' who is recast here in a fair light. She was a survivor, a incredibly bright and industrious woman sold into slavery who had a chance at a better life, especially for her children.  <br/><br/>Her story is symptomatic of all of the peoples of the area. The worst aspect of contact was disease. There several were truly devastating epidemics. Though the political order and local way of life did not change that much, the Spaniards, indeed aided by horses, war dogs, and most of all steel were not there to wipe them out but to take over at hegemons. It was an extractive exercise, brutal at times, but it was a slow process. Peoples in the countryside decades later may have never seen a Spaniard. The local elites were demoted, but used by the Spanish. This is in stark contrast with the methods used further North, here it was slow destruction of the peoples by any and all methods. <br/> Explored here in the excellent ""Journey of Humanity"" https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4699911286?type=review#rating_493847946 or here in fictional form by Dee Brown - https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2598265259?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1 .<br/><br/>The local way of life is vividly portrayed, both before and after conquest. Is is very different to the societies we live in, fascinating. My only little issue is that it could have been more lurid, more brutal. The author does not hide from the gore of human sacrifice or the desperate battles, but she does not revel in it either. On the podcast ""History on Fire"" I get that. Lots of cannibalism, human sacrifice, dogs eating people. As a proper historian I'm sure she wanted to avoid sensationalism but I am looking for it here!  <br/><br/>Should be a first stop for anyone wanting to understand the 'Aztecs' !",,,1,0

This is an excellent fictionalized telling of the story. <br/><br/>A nice literary device allows for a single conversation to tell the tale through the titular Creek Mary's grandson Dane. We are first told of her notable youth and life, then through his 80+ years. This takes us from dealings and trouble with the British in the 1700s, through wars of the local, independence and civil varieties, a thousand broken promises and treaties, constant land grabs, massacres and horrors right through to Teddy Roosevelt at the dawn of the 1900's (!). There is a wonderful undercurrent of changing technology through this time too, horses and illiterate people to the pony express, then railways and telegrams. <br/><br/>The story is gripping, the action well done, the pain and horror brilliantly rendered. This more than makes up for the writing not quite being literary level, or the odd one dimensional character - the venal Colonel Belcourt could have been several people as opposed to a recurring one for instance. <br/><br/>In general I was impressed by the complexity of the characters, early on the Long Warrior ponders the meaning of savagery with Mary after a white child is murdered ""down beneath the skin, no matter the colour, down there we are all fierce, cruel, bloodthirsty as the beasts, it is part of the balance of nature"". Though, the savagery becomes increasingly one sided. <br/><br/>There are good times too, somewhat idyllic visions of Native American life outside the white man's world. These come early on before the Native tribes are forced off their land in the east, and later on the plains with the buffalo herds. The destruction of this way of life through the elimination of the buffalo is emblematic of the cruelty, waste, and cynical nature of this slow genocide. <br/><br/>I recently read ""Fifth Sun; a new history of the Aztecs"" https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44244939-fifth-sun<br/>and it was illuminating how this, also horrific European takeover, differed to the Northern one. The Spanish established themselves as hegemon, as extractors at the top in an established system. Further North it was removal of the original inhabitants, by any and all means, slowly but steadily, and full replacement with new peoples and new systems. They were 'in the way' and explicitly excluded from political representation - a terrible crime that greenlit the more violent ones that followed. <br/><br/>Another parallel is the great detail on the messy situation once contact is made, it's never as simple as them and us, with native populations having huge differences between and within themselves. Interactions, alliances and cross race marriages are common. It's a cultural pastiche and partnership, especially early on. Later less so, with devastating consequences. Some of the psychological impacts of this are explored in Pleasant's sad story here, and put forward as believable motives for Malintzin/Malinche, Cortez's essential local translator in the ""Fifth Sun"". <br/><br/>It is hard to feel anything but horror and burning injustice at the fate of the Native American tribes. ""The only thing your people ever gave mine - pain, desolation and death"". I have met several Native Americans during my travels in America, always lovely people. I heard a wonderful redemption story told by the excellent Stanislav Grof on the Tim Ferris podcast. Invited to a Native peyote session, one Indian was angry with the white guests for the above reasons and refused to communicate with them. Towards the end the leaders thanked the outsiders for coming, especially Stanislav who had came from Czechoslovakia. The Angry man broke down and begged forgiveness. He assumed they were all American. He had been drafted during WW2, and he was on a plane that bombed the Czech town where Stanislav lived just before the end of the war. He had been drawn into horror by powers outside of his control.<br/><br/>This shows how normal people are sucked into wars, they often don't choose, or don't understand what their choice means. So many native Americans took part in all the wars, on all sides, including the 'Indian wars' with Crow's scouting for Custer at Little Bighorn for instance. So many Irish fought in the American civil war, again on both sides, many of these then again against the tribes too. A story told in the excellent ""Days without End"" https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3009687043?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1"" by Sebastian Barry. Pawns in the brutal games of the powerful. Twigs standing before the hurricane of progress. We are all savages now. <br/><br/>I say this believing in the power, necessity and good arc of historical progress. At times I can only squint my eyes, it came at such a human cost. It did not have to be so painful. Linking a to a wider story, the destruction of nature does not need to be so brutal today (The Overstory by Richard Powers https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4768937887?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1). Lessons can still be learned and actions still can be changed. But we are all savages now. <br/><br/>A section in the final few pages has a hopeful tone, with Dane's granddaughter, who we are teased with sporadically throughout the book finally shows up. She is portrayed as a true American, a wise and determined young doctor, with the blood of many tribes, speckled with touches of European flowing through her. I'm not sure we can say even today that this ideal is rendered true, at least, not often. Whilst things have improved no doubt, the Native American population continue to suffer disproportionately the ills of modern society, and continue to face injustice at the hands of the US government. <br/><br/>The government, deservedly, gets it in the neck. The words published in 1980 are even more pertinent today. Maybe this highlights a true rotten core in Washington that has always been there. Depressing if so. Washington D.C . is framed as a den of vice and lies, something apart from what is was designed to be, staffed with ""Scoundrels, thieves, liars, betrayers of those who gave them power"". <br/><br/>Amen.",,,1,0

The ability to make me so invested, so quickly, in so many ways blew me away. This section alone would be worthy of literary prizes. <br/><br/>During these stories, especially the later ones, we have hints dropped here and there, what could almost be throw-away lines, but then no, here it is again, followed by a relavatory section, religious in intensity.

Later we skip forward, and I feel we lose some of the urgency, there is less plot and more politics.

Well, yes it's this one. <br/><br/>""The best argumens in the world won't change a person's mind, the only thing that can do that is a good story"" <br/><br/>I thought the ending brought it back on track, not easy or providing all the answers but in keeping with the sadness, complexity and overaching long term hope of the whole book. <br/><br/>The (accurate) scientific information about trees peppered throughout the book is astonishing. Wow. Yes people do need to know more. Essential. Though, there is a real focus on the trees, rather than the wider biosphere, trees themselves, while ancient compared to us, are younger than sharks. The urgency is both wider than forests, and maybe (hopefully) not as acute as the writer makes out. <br/><br/>The literary aspects are first rate, it stopped me in my tracks to ponder sentences time and time again  <br/><br/>""life has a way if talking to the future, it's called memory""<br/><br/>One of the quotes on the cover of my copy claims ""it makes you see the world differently"" I sure do, a remarkable feat. <br/><br/>There is a final twist to a popular quote from earlier in the book, the writer add a few words and it changes the original meaning significantly (minor spoiler alert) ""the most wondrous products of 4 billion years of life need help"" later adding ""not them; us."" <br/><br/>Amen, as Watchman might say.",,,1,0

Does a good job staying focused on the biggest of human stories, evolution, survival, growth, inequality and the future while remaining interesting throughout. <br/><br/>There is a bold target to hit - a unified theory of humanity from stagnation to sustained growth. Highlighting what underlying forces drive this, by providing deep insights backed by data not just the usual surface level explanations. So, a big topic and clearly one with a positive grand arc! The author clearly sees human progress and thinks it is a good thing, as do I. <br/><br/>It is a good sign that the author comes very close to his goal. I have only minor quibbles thuth be told. We have an engaging and at times original book, with the story of growth told forwards and inequality told backwards - all the way back to Africa, novel. Those first steps out of Africa become very important. <br/><br/>We begin with the evolution of powerful brains, why only once? And move quickly into more economic based talk where the author is more comfortable, yes we have had material<br/>improvements since we walked out of Africa, yet not pet person until recently. Humanity was gripped in the Mathulsean poverty trap until recent centuries. <br/><br/>Material gains driven by more people and a demand for more invention where cancelled out by more mouths to feed until an eqlibrium was established. The data does work consistently when combined with the timing of neolithic and agriculturial revolutions.  <br/><br/>We have the big civilisations first in water based areas. Homogenous civilisations. Control, stability. Europe for example could only thrive much later with better technology as competition drove growth and sutible differences in political institutions, coupled with fewer though better educated children, allowed for the escape from the poverty trap.<br/><br/>The escape out of the trap would require a large population size and, population diversity. The core of his original argument and data is this population diversity aspect. The other reasons are well accepted, and if I may say better explained in say Youval Harari's ""Sapiens"" or individually in specialist books.<br/><br/>The claims on how important genetic diversity is are up for debate. He claims a sweet spot on a hump shaped graph. Not too diverse or a lack of social cohesion hampers growth, nor too homogenous as a lack of niches and variation will do the same, especially once new technologies are added to the mix. <br/><br/>The USA today comes out as the best place to live! The GDP weighting here must have an outsized effect. The author is clear that no one factor is determinate but that they have an cosiderible effect, even now. He states that about a quarter of average income per Capita is due to this diversity, with local climate 20%, diesese prevelance 7%, ethno-cultural reasons 20%, and poltical institutions 10% being the other top drivers. So it's a huge effect if proved true. <br/><br/>It leads to interesting policy questions, can we foster diversity to increase $$$ or drop it in, say Ethiopia for the same reason? The author states that just knowing it is there can allow us to educate and design policy to correct for such cases. <br/><br/>I found the section on Climate change a bit short, pretty much just says will be fine if we get rich as the rich societies in Europe went green per person once wealthy... hmmm I'll need a lot more than that. <br/><br/>Though he was great with data from natural experiments, repeatadly. <br/><br/>Also very good on colonialism - with the brutality highlighted through death rates, and interesting data on the differences of extractive eliete takeover (Spanish in south and central America) vs 'empty land' via genocide (British in North America or Australia) on the development and success of new institutions there. Agrees with Francis Fukiama here on South America. Another good sign. <br/><br/>Insightful on why Western development economics and politics are wrong when enforced on other countries, these are shell copies of western institutions on populations that are not ready, they don't have the social or political bedrock ready yet, deep history won't let it work, not recent history but the distant past. These are good thoughts, something is there no doubt, but I'm sure we have counter examples that disprove it as a rule. <br/><br/>Very good for all who want to understand the journey of humanity, a good update and complement to other famous world histories, but as always more research needed!",,,1,0

Published in 1920 it feels close to the action not the longer term consequences. The memoir of a lower ranking (insanely?) brave young officer who is swept up by his world view, think duty, glory, chivalry, honour, patriotism. He's idealistic but not blind or stupid, he knows what's coming and in no way shies away from the coming storm. <br/><br/>What's atypical is that he is not availed of these feelings despite the absolute horror he continually faces. It is not going to far to suggest Junger enjoyed it. He appreciated the war for sure. For both philosophical and excitement reasons. <br/><br/>""life has no meaning except when pledged for an ideal, no other generation has been so favoured""<br/><br/>Even the outcome of the war does not change his mind - ""the fallen did not die for nothing, for resolve"" it was worth it - a way of proving their mettle. <br/><br/>You can indeed read a lot of Niczhean uberman into his worldview, immense strength of character, ideals persevering through the toughest tests, personality coming through apparently intact despite 14 serious wounds. <br/><br/>Maybe I wanted him to see the folly of his ways, maybe I wanted comment on the stupidity and waste of war, maybe that's why I liked ""All quiet on the Western front"" so much - maybe that's an issue my side. The book really is focused on the fighting, 1914-18 without wider comment, from someone who was there, as an example of that it is unsurpassed. <br/><br/>The writing/translation is genuinly spectacular too.",,,1,0

There is little else you can ask for from literature. Stretches the mind, asks pertinent questions on what it means to be human, is wildly entertaining and is quite wonderfully structured.<br/><br/>The premise is a pandemic, one with an inverse death rate compared to covid (99+%). However the story centers around a famous actor who dies (of natural causes) on stage in the first few chapters. The tendrils of his life, reach out to the distant past and 20 years in the future where most of the plot takes place. It won't all come together until the end, and an unpublished graphic novel, the titular Station Eleven, is the lynchpin of it all. <br/><br/>There are scenes of great brutality and desperation, yet it feels a very realistic if twisted world 20 years later. It is not as bleak or horrific as Cormac McCarthy's 'The Road' - maybe because they have more food. His book has but the faintest flicker of light, here there is more, with the 'Star Trek Voyager' Seven of 9 inspired motif ""Survival is Insufficient"" literally written on the bodies and sideboards of our traveling Shakespeare performing symphony.  Hope is the pervading emotion even in the darkest situations. <br/><br/>The parts set in the pre pandemic world are wonderful too, the lives of our characters, mundane or exotic, are skillfully filled out and this really helps punch the reader in the stomach when our modern world, so full of wonder and miracles, is taken away overnight. It is often remarked in the future period that those young enough to not rember the old world have a much easier time, I feel this would be true if true calamity did strike. <br/><br/>It feels so complete as a book I would have thought that they would have struggled to translate it to the screen, though the reviews of the series are good. <br/><br/>I'm glad that it both was an award winning book pre pandemic and a huge success afterwards - it shows it's quality outside of our now common experience of pandemic and just how much she was able to get right about how people and governments would react - often very poorly but with touching moments of humanity. The sense of disbelief, panic, the breaking of some but interestingly not all societal standards and norms are palatable. <br/><br/>Read it!",,,1,0

I'm left wanting more but not feeling that anything was missed out. <br/><br/>I read these as a collection and I could feel the change of tone through the three. From a self contained and straightforward (though foundational) story at first, through a more complex second featuring dreams and tales of defining battles elsewhere, to a story where we are the protagonists at the center of an rebellion meeting top level players - I could almost feel George desperately trying to stop himself writing a full series on the Blackfyre rebellions - though I'd happily take that!  <br/><br/>Dunc and Egg are both 'good' and likable characters, not as grey as most in the main series - plenty of grey in those we meet. Dunc is a representation of a true knight like his suspected descendent Brienne, Egg seems likely to have made a wise ruler - interesting to see what happens on the long road to Summerhall. <br/><br/>The only strong link to the main series comes through Bloodraven - not mentioned (or even  named by George at that time I believe) at first, later met. A dark and complex character - very grey and with lots of potential for Bran's future. We see a baby Walder Frey too! but the rest is ancestors and parallels - for more info here check out the excellent History of Wrsteros podcasts. <br/><br/>There are many comic moments - often at the perceived expense of the self depreciating, socially intelligent but uneducated 'Dunk the lunk'. <br/><br/>Would love to read more, preferably after TWOW though!",,,1,0

Like the second the best parts come in two big switches from the main narrative, the dream and the blind maistro's story. Like a 20th century Dostoyevski. <br/><br/>There is also a major time jump at the end, much more dramatic than the one in ""Blood Meridian"" yet similar as we also (possibly) have a dark, supernatural meeting. I really liked the section, but understand the reservations about it. <br/><br/>In typical McCarthy fashion we have some astounding writing hidden, almost thrown away in single sentences or passages that are not part of the story, it's a great skill and something that keeps me coming back for more.

As a surgeon, the examples the writer takes are all from the medical world but are generally applicable elsewhere. <br/><br/>Rather than looking at medical or technical breakthroughs, he looks at three areas where we can all improve with some startling and touching examples. Diligence, ingenuity, and what it takes to do right are the three sections. <br/><br/>Seemingly mundane topics like hand washing are vividly rendered as essential. The successful and importantly, unsuccessful, methods used today are highlighted with the wider lessons useful for everyone.<br/><br/>Some sections seem slightly out of place, the medical assistance in death penalty cases section is good, the most philosophical section of the book, but does not seem to fit so well with the rest.<br/><br/>The book is quite US focused so expect lots of insurance industry talk, some of it slightly dated. It is well put, though not super important to a Brit. The sections in India are among the best. <br/><br/>There is a particularly great part on medicine as a craft, versus an industry. How the best results in a specific situations may not yeild the best chances overall. The example centers on the use of forceps compared to Cesarean section. While better results are demonstrated with skilled use of forceps, the standardized, easily taught operation can be done with much less training giving it far greater reach, especially in remote areas.

The story, characters, and writing are all engaging and display emotional depth. <br/><br/>I saw it labbled 'gringa porn' by the reviewer Black Oxford, fair enough! We do have a smorgasbord of the horrors that face many migrants today. None of it is overblown or invented however, the reality can be gruesome. <br/><br/>There was some very modern outrage over this book after it became popular, with many people angry that a white American wrote a book from a perspective that is not her's, but this has no bearing on me, I read a lot of sci-fi and don't insist it is written by hyper intelligent ouctopi from the future. Some of the Spanish, especially the slang, and cultural flourishes may be off, I'm not sure. <br/><br/>For me a bigger issue is a plot point that could be entirely exercised without damaging the emotional hit or story of the book, it would even improve it. The shared love of literature and the chance meeting of the main character and the bad guy is unbelievable, in the literal sense. Everything else could have remained without that link. <br/><br/>Some of the writing is a little clunky ""she felt like an egg. But she could not tell if she were the yolk, white or shell.

He manages to synthesize disparate topics into a quite beautiful whole while explaining truly befuddling ideas and results as well as can be done. <br/><br/>Tangents such as the political theories of Lenin and Bogdanov? Philosophical questions on consciousness? Evolution, neuroscience, and sprinkles of autobiographical tidbits? All in just 200 pages of a quantum physics book? Absolutely. <br/><br/>The actual story and science of the book is well set out. The early breakthroughs, the protagonists and their historical origins, the startling effects. Then an exploration of the possible answers to the mystery, first the explanations the author does not agree with, then the relational theory he does. <br/><br/>The relational model is in opposition to the many words theory so we'll explained in David Detuch's work. From memory, Detuch seems far more set in stone with his beliefs while my lay mind was easily swayed as well as intrigued here. <br/><br/>It is posited that anything is real only in relation to something else at that moment, otherwise we are not able to talk about it. Nothing can exist outside of relations to other things, no objective point of view. Every vision is partial, there is no absolute or universal point of view, only portions of reality, a huge network of mirrors. This is true on the micro and macro levels. Particles going through slits in experiments and a human speeding on the motorway. <br/><br/>Some of the tangents here are incredibly interesting. Including 'changes to the terms of the question' for the mind body problem in philosophy. The distinction is simply removed by seeing meaning as a physical biological thing, not a mental state. <br/><br/>The impulse is 100% substantiated in the physical world, an evolutionary adaption based on a relation to the world. So there is no need to fret about mental vs physical, it's all physical, mental qualia are physical representations or relations of the world. Linked together through others. This removes the subject-object issue via entanglement. Elegant and radical. We, our ""I"" is the name of the natural processes naming themselves! Ha! <br/><br/>There is a good short point on the latest neuroscience of vision, explaining we don't see the world, rather we predict it and report back discrepancies. This is the world as a confirmed hallucination. Also explored in the outstanding ""how emotions are made"".<br/><br/>The book ends with a beautiful Prospero quote from the Tempest ""we are such stuff as our dreams are made of, and our life is rounded with a sleep""<br/><br/>To be re-read!",,,1,0

That may say more about me that the book.<br/><br/>This is a superbly researched, thorough world history from an interesting and important perspective. I love books like this, yet the structure left me a little cold. <br/><br/>There is a fair bit of physics at the beginning, and the whole book is very academic - ponderous at times illuminating at others. Early on we don't really 'hear' the authors voice, it comes through later, acerbic and funny, and it improves the book. I wouldn't like to pull up to him driving an 'SUV' while nicely tanned! The end is very strong, fantastic writing. <br/><br/>We are told that this is an updated version of an earlier work, and I can see he has released several smaller books on sections of this work. It may be they are better taken in smaller chunks, and/or that his style has changed for the better over time. <br/><br/>I mean, we learn enough about animal harnesses and waterwheels to last us right through the next energy transition! Yet we also have single paragraphs that contain more insight than entire books I've read! <br/><br/>Both the cited and the authors own research is impeccable. The ideas are insightful yet measured, with him going out of his way to caveat predictions about the future and avoiding wild, though tempting theories. <br/><br/>He explains expertly the control of increasing amounts of energy is key, but not deterministic. Highlighting alternative paths taken in the past. The idea of money as a proxy for energy is also prescient given the bitcoin debate right now!<br/><br/>Some of the statistics are startling - people in Sudan today use the same amount of energy as people in the Roman empire, far lower than 1820s Britain, and orders of magnitude lower than conterpoary Americans. Western governments make more money from taxing oil than the producers do for selling it.<br/><br/>The dual nature of energy transitions is demonstrated - they have positive and negative effects, always creating an alternative set of problems - this reminds me of David Deutsch's ideas in the beginning of Infinity. Abundant food and population density, vs environmental destruction and climate change.<br/><br/>Overall the message for today is not super positive.This is based on the reality of previous energy shifts. Fundamental energy shifts define history but they are far slower than people realise. 3 generations slow. Coal was the fuel of the 20th century not the 19th. Oil is a relative newcomer.

But I have recently read ""The Brothers Karamazov"" <br/> (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2926789483) and I must say I find this a far better work of fiction and literature. Dostoyevsky's book is illuminated by two spellbinding sections that take place out of the immediate reality of the story - and we have the same here. I will call them the fables of the sorrowful man and the blind man respectfully. Most of the philosophy and big questions come during these amazing, almost non-sequitur sections. Though for me the rest of the story is more exciting and visceral here. <br/><br/>It is a strangely structured and paced novel, with a steady coming of age story combined with a wolf hunt taking up the first third or so, then sometimes jarring changes of pace hit you fast; tragedy, deceit, philosophy, history, murder, fables, faith, shootouts and a civil war! Throw in some gypsies, Natives, and there's just enough time left for a love story too. <br/><br/>There are some chapters from the wolf's point of view - these are beautifully done, the only comparable sections I know of are the wolf sections on Game of Thrones. <br/><br/>The writing is sparse and harsh, like the people and landscape they exist in. You can miss major events simply because they hardly talk about it! Yet is is so beautiful, as with his other works there are absolute gems almost thrown away casually - often by minor of one off characters, the Indians he meets on his first trip warning him not to wander for ever, that ""his heart and world are with others, if you wander too long you lose it forever, the world is a part of us"" or simply ""Life is memory then nothing"".<br/><br/>This is a far more exciting book compared to the first, with far more action and violence - at one point someone sucks out the eyes of a man (the fabled blind man) leaving them dangling...<br/><br/>And as you should expect by now in McCarthy's novels it's dark dark dark. Don't expect a Hollywood ending. Don't even expect a nice ending (or no ending!) for those minor one off characters! I laughed out load when a doctor is killed off for no other reason than the author is a sick twisted man!

I was worried where exactly the sequel would take us, but it is both imaginative - with a new species thrown into the genetically enhanced mix, and distinctive enough from the first with a terrifying horror element thrown in. <br/><br/>These sections, with their slow build up, puzzling clues and horrific outcomes are the best parts of the book (if a little reminiscent of the protomolecule for Expanse readers).<br/><br/>The new species, Octopus, makes a fine choice.

We have an interstellar civilisation, one so far advanced they have forgot about Earth, unknowingly teetering on the edge of collapse. And one man, an unlikable one at that, has foresaw the fall, mathematically no less. His plan is to make the coming dark age shorter, a novel idea versus trying to stave off the danger.<br/><br/>The book is wise on how and why collapse happens, or happened for Rome at least! Squabbles on the periphery devoid of hegemonic power, a bloated core regressing steadily but not immediately. Mentioning that future historians wont even agree on a single date or event. How very true!<br/><br/>The story is clever, both conceptually and with the political machinations that play out in each stage, I was consistently surprised as we go on a tour of the history of power, in space - raw power - religion - capitalism and financial domination - really just like Rome and the West. Mary Beard writes of this today, how Rome traded in armies and land Empire for control of peoples souls, all roads still lead to Rome, but it became administered by bishops not legions.<br/><br/>The vision of the future is quaint by todays standards, with nuclear power ruling all, and some stuff we have today outstripping their millennia advanced tech - but i mean its from the 50s no hard feelings :)<br/><br/>The story itself has great twists, its exciting and fun. It jumps about in time quite a lot, with little continuity - there is no time to really get to know any of the characters (almost all of whom are men, i think a woman makes a single speaking role as a traded wife!). <br/><br/>The middle sections are well thought out and follow a nice structure, however i must sat the beginning and end are weird. The beginning has a quite silly introduction to the new planet, ending in a chase and arrest within a few hours, seems out of pace with the rest of the story.

Best when on her strong points, science and philosophy, weakest when drifting into politics and her personal life (not to disparage connecting with her audience).<br/><br/>The main thesis here is that modern 'parenting' (the lifestyle and industry) is flawed, and that being a caring parent is far more beneficial to all concerned. So not constructing a productive future worker but creating a safe space where they can explore the world independently. Solid, backed up by good science and reasoning.<br/><br/>The science is modern, top draw and explaining beautifully. A few highlights include how climate change caused humans long before we did it back. Our key adaption as sapiens is described as an ability to adapt to variability, to changes in any environment, not to a change in an environment. Interesting thought.<br/><br/>More specifically on children the key role of play and pretending is explored. Open play interpreted as testing the world, demonstrating how smart kids are more interested when their thorey of world is challenged. Pretending is shown to develop theory of mind, with those who predend more (including imaginary friends) developing stronger insights here. (As is reading fiction, especially literary fiction, in adults - it increased empathy and facial expression spotting. Very interesting.) It is shown how terrible it is to grow up without play and playmates.  <br/><br/>Childrens acute sensitivity to teaching, is expertly demonstrated. They know when they are being instructed as opposed to simply exploring a new thing with someone, and thus will follow, but won't explore past the instruction...the lesson here being to let them explore - at least often and when appropriate.<br/><br/>Shout out for the New Caledonia crows! Using tools to make tools, incredibly smart, stemming from a huge 2 year childhood, where they play and explore, test and fail.<br/><br/>It could be said there is a little too much personal information, though it does for with the book.

Nestled within these three major arcs there are many super interesting viginettes and secondary arcs. We visit many corners of this new world, and at multiple time points. Brilliantly filled up with strange flora and fauna. Bold, complex, confident writing. I am fully invested. <br/><br/>I must credit this book for finally showing me why fantasy is so often lumped together with sci-fi, this baffled me in the past, but now I see how elements such as original world building, new religious, social, or philosophical structures, combined with novel geography and biology sync so well - one uses magic the other technology.<br/><br/>The magic here is well thought out, complex but coherent (so far at least). Some elements, especially those revealed at the end have the scope to go way off piste in later books, but I'm in for the whole slope now come what may. <br/><br/>The story is brutal, realistic, violent. It was this aspect of GOT that so hooked me, it bridges the divide to the fantasy realm and to the actual past. <br/><br/>There are sections that jump off the page, some of the battles are so well done, reminds me of Tolstoy. Visceral. Some wonderful philosophical asides too, not just at the library but also when visiting the island. <br/><br/>A lot of work goes into payoffs at the end, so prepare to make that investment.

Expect lots of talk of GINI coefficients and top income shares. An immense amount of research went into it. There is a well built model and an interesting book structure. He recognizes the novel construction and acknowledges its flaws, along with data quality/availability issues. <br/><br/>We brilliantly span time from our ape forbearers and their shoulder adaptations, to speculations on the mid-term future and our cyber enhancements! Chimes nicely with Homo Deus by Yuval Noah Harari on this point.  We go global, yet granular, with A fascinating study of a single German town during the 30 years war sticking in the mind.<br/><br/>The thesis is that only the 'four horseman' have ever caused significant and lasting economic compression - and always by levelling the top never by raising the bottom segment of society. The four horseman are mass mobilization warfare, total revolutions, state collapse, and pandemics. The first two are only really applicable to modern times. He includes their after effects, so the 30 year post WW2 inclusive boom is argued to be a direct consequence and not a new phenomenon. <br/><br/>I find a few of the suppositions like this arguable, but I cant reject any myself. I have come to see my communist acquaintances with a type of pity, I see their good intentions but misdiagnosis of capitalism as the issue, when its just humanity. Surplus leads to stratification, no need for capitalism. (Communism as applied in real life gets a deserved shellacking here for the untold misery and death it inflicted upon its unfortunate victims.) <br/><br/>The somewhat bleak outlook of the book comes from its unmistakable conclusions - inequality is almost a natural force, it rises inexorably over time unless smashed apart but one (or multiple!) of the horsemen. While this may appeal to the downtrodden or revolutionary among you, this is always worse for the poor, devastatingly bad. With some upside if you survive (better wages and conditions for labourers after the Black Death for example - but you have to survive the black death first). Soon enough inequality begins to rise once more. No other mechanism we have tried works, not economic growth, progressive tax, democracy, land reform or anything else - some ameliorate, but none reverse the trend. Nor would the main policy adjustments suggested by Tony Atkinson - noble winning expert on inequality. <br/><br/>Inequality has been booming since at least the 80s, with the 1% the main beneficiaries, this is all set to continue, as we have seen even during the pandemic with Bezos and Musk in particular, but all the 1% as a collective. European aging and anti immigrant sentiments will compound these trends. <br/><br/>My only glint of light here, comes from the question not addressed (on purpose) of just how bad is inequality in a modern rich society? As the author notes, most of the horsemen seem to have been wounded, if not banished  (including pandemics if you look at the death toll in % terms). <br/><br/>If we become ever more unequal, yet the poor are richer than 99% of all humans that have ever lived, with good living standards combined with accessible medical and education systems will it be OK? I think maybe. At least not bad enough to force revolution. I am not suggesting we are there now, not in any major developed country, but I don't think we are so far away historically speaking, a kind of global Luxembourg. Boring but nice, even for the poorest.<br/><br/>On equity ""we would do well to remember that with the rarest exception it was only ever brought forth with sorrow"" indeed.<br/><br/>",,,1,0

An example of my favourite history books, one that deeply informs me of an area I have neglected while simultaneously overturning the accepted position. Brilliantly written, weaving together what are at first glance disparate conflicts into a beautiful yet bloody tapestry that would only foretell even greater suffering to come. <br/><br/>This is the history of the 'post-war' years (mostly 1917-23) over a huge arc of land from the frozen arctic tundra to the middle east. Spoiler the 'war' never ended for most of the peoples of these lands, it just changed its name and scope. The 'peace' post war just created the conditions for future devastation.  <br/><br/>It charts the fall of the old empires, these states and their peoples becoming vanquished, including surprisingly some of the 'victors' of the war such as Italy and Ireland, as a battered Europe struggled to come to terms with new realities. We have the seeds of the ethnic conflicts and the ushering in of an age of extremes that would convulse Europe and the world into the next official world war. <br/><br/>The violence and suffering were off the charts, with millions dead - even excluding the flu pandemic and the famines caused by the various conflicts. The brutality is hard to fathom, from the German brigades in the Baltic states, to the Soviet policies to their own people, to the expulsion of the Greeks from the new Turkish state - some of whom, the Pontic Greeks, had been there since 600 BC! Think mass burnings, disembowelling's, crucifixions, and people skinned alive. Now that's history! And sadly the world would see it writ large a few years later. <br/><br/>Its a tragedy and condemnation that only Finland (not for long) and Czechoslovakia (already reduced) remained by 1939 of the post war states. <br/><br/>The Jews as so often has been the case, suffered as much as anyone, finding it was better to be part of a multi ethnic empire rather than as a minority in a ethno-nationalist state to their great cost, repeatedly. <br/><br/>The new states created from the carcasses of the old empires were ethnically homogenous in the minds of their planners only - Poland was 35% non Polish, there were more Germans in Czechoslovakia than Slovaks. This, mashed together with revolutions across much of the continent led to chaos, violence, and a brutal resort of masses of peoples. The sections on the American President Wilson are excellent, especially his personal mental gymnastics allowing him to believe in enforced racial differences and self determination of peoples! Also his difficulty with idealism and violent realities - including dealing with the new threat of worldwide communist revolution. <br/><br/>It is easy to understand the vanquished powers sense of injustice at the peace settlements forced upon them, they were terrible! This is widely know about the treaty of Versailles, yet I was not aware that this was the best of a terrible lot! With most of the others falling to pieces not long after the war. There are great explanations of why they became what they were. <br/><br/>The sections of the multiple revolutions (many of witch I did not even know about!) are lucid and illuminating. Eye opening on how Japan reacted to their side-lining post war - the racial discrimination sending them off on a path that leads to the next war. <br/><br/>The pillars of devastation reminded me of the 4 great levelling horsemen described brilliantly by Walter Scheider, state collapse, revolutions, full mobilisation warfare, and pandemic. All were here, all caused outrageous suffering. A time of wreckage and desolation. <br/><br/><br/><br/>",,,1,0

That the humour still shines through is a testament to the writing. The historical context of the story is important, and this part does not break through as vividly - I listened along with The Very Bad Wizards podcast, this really helped me understand this aspect which enlivened the whole experience. <br/><br/>The story itself is not particularly gripping until the end of the book. The philosophical, phycological, and sociological commentary is what entertains and challenges us up to that point. The ending brings these aspects all together with the story - yet in many ways leaves most answers open. We are left to ponder and decide ourselves. The lack of resolution a comment in itself. <br/><br/>The two sections that jump off the page are rightfully world famous, and without knowing where they were I was still instantly gripped. The first are the arguments around God that culminate with the Grand Inquisitor. The second the delirious discussion with the devil - these reminded me of The Master and Margarita, a book written much later that i happen to have read before. Absolutely Outstanding, wow. I would suggest them as required reading for anyone religious in particular. And not just because they can be seen to push atheism, it is more subtle, more open to interpretation. <br/><br/>You can see why the book and Dostoyevsky influenced so much of continental philosophy and thought in the proceeding years. I felt the presence in works I've read by Freud, Nietzsche and several of the famous existentialists. Expect lots of thinking on meaning, free will, faith, freedom, justice, responsibility. <br/><br/>I'm personally not religious, though occasionally spiritual and the book speaks to that side of me. The boundless and non-dogmatic love that several characters either work towards or stumble upon. The more obviously Christian aspects are wasted on me, and i feel many of us in the 21st century. A simplistic reading could juxtapose reason vs faith as the central theme of the story, super important in the 19th century yes, but now, in modern Europe? For me at least the answer is clear. Though some snippets remind me of a full blooded youth - it being good for passion to override reason in the young for one. <br/><br/>I must give a mention to some of the funniest moments - the discussion on temporary insanity as a legal defence is hilarious and the quote that ""generally speaking the Russian peasant deserves to be flogged"" really tickled me! <br/><br/>The beginning is a little slow, and many of the characters are unbelievably melodramatic, and the very end gets very Jesusy all of a sudden but this remains a great read with important philosophical and psychological points - even if for me it may have lost some of its original force over the years. <br/><br/>",,,1,0

13588394,The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail—But Some Don't,Nate Silver,"Silver, Nate",,"=""159420411X""","=""9781594204111""",4,3.97,Penguin,Hardcover,544,2012,2012,2020/11/28,2020/09/26,,,read,"Very good and slightly surprising book, only missing out on 5* due to an understandable American slant. <br/><br/>Surprising, despite the sub title, as from a famous analyst/statistician this is more about how predictions fail, where the issues are, rather than how brilliant they are and how everything will soon be solved. As the author puts it less about what we know, than the difference between what we know and what we think we know. <br/><br/>The tone is exploratory, humble, and insightful. Much more by the way of understanding the world rather than explaining it - with a good dose of autobiographical detail thrown in too. Nate Silver is a very good writer, painting a vivid picture of the places and situations described, as well as explaining complex situations to general readers. <br/><br/>Most sections explore a topic in prediction or statistics through a lived experience or major world event. This gives the book a slightly uneven feel, some chapters are far more engaging than others, especially I feel for non-Americans. The weakest chapters were on baseball, elements of the climate change one, and terrorism. The book was far stronger on the financial crisis, weather systems, epidemics, chess, and Bayes theorem. Some others on poker and politics were middling. <br/><br/>He is able to distil excellent general points, more data does not mean better prediction, with ever more noise it may be harder to hear the signal. Exponential data increases as we have seen since the books publication leave us with more hypothesis and more false positives. Are we sure we were right with the prediction for the reasons we say, or was it something else? We have more data, but the same amount of truth as 1000 years ago. Proper analysis of long term predictions is rare. <br/><br/>The distinction on tactics vs strategy regarding chess and computer power was enlightening. Brilliant for its time at least, the developments in deep mind have made even these human domains fall now. Be interesting to see Nate's updated thoughts on the matter.  <br/><br/>Insightful and prescient on the stock market when talking about the .com boom are crash - the parallels to today are astonishing, we are ""buying a particular vision of tomorrow"" unattached form realities - see Tesla stock price rise! (not that it will fall necessarily). Misaligned incentives for annalists create market irregularities and bubbles. <br/><br/>While part of the climate change section is outdated  he is great when talking about scientist who don't forecast and forecasters who don't do the science, as well as a cutting analysis of both the political and media landscape regarding the issue. So far simple models have been better, yet he discounts any possible major shifts in the future as they have not/had not happened yet (such as methane release, rapid ice melting, tipping points tipping...)<br/><br/>Both the analysis and characterisation of 'us' (the United States) in the terrorism chapter are weak and telling. Clearly affected by 9/11 he seems very worried of another even bigger (nuclear or biological) attack in the US. This seems incredibly unlikely give the relative capabilities of any terrorist organisation today. And there is no talk of the cost or consequences of the US response to 9/11 - which have been worse for both 'us' and to a far larger extent anyone unfortunate enough to be 'them'. He does speak well of the Israeli response to terrorism, one of a criminal action not an existential threat. Though they have a aggressive stance on genuine existential threats - see Iran and nuclear development!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>",,,1,0

An extortionary ceremonial site had been excavated and dated to 4300 years ago. There they found the skull of a long extinct auroch that was used as a headdress - it was estimated to be two thousand years old at the time it was placed into the water there! I had to find out more about the peoples that led such extraordinary lives for so many generations so long ago.<br/><br/>(https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jun/28/archaeologists-stumble-on-neolithic-ritual-site-in-suffolk)<br/><br/>This book did not let me down, though it may have left me pining for more. It is a first rate academic text on the history of the British isles from pre history through the age of the Northmen. I say academic as it is, but it is completely readable and most illuminating for the lay history reader like myself.  <br/><br/>This is not a dense, theory led, and argument heavy book, rather a clear, measured, and evidence backed narrative of life on the British isles over many millennia. <br/><br/>As such it sticks firmly to the facts, or best evidence, with little time for imagining just what was going on day to day, who were these people and what did they believe, impossible to say but hard to stop day dreaming!<br/><br/>The book is excellent in all periods it looks at, pre history is heavy on things like geology, climate and food sources as archaeological evidence is sparse. Later we have more evidence of trade networks, belief systems, new peoples and ideas, and violent conflict. <br/><br/>The pre-roman times were the most obscured in my mind, and it was here I took the most from the book. Repeatedly mind blowing. The consistent and ancient sea links to Europe, often far flung Europe, in particular stick in the mind. As does the Western vs South East distinction that I feel even today! <br/><br/>It is hard to imagine the time scales involved here, we are significantly closer to Julius Ceaser than he was to the builders of Stonehenge - and that was built on already ancient ceremonial ground. <br/><br/>To the authors credit the latter chapters on more familiar subjects - Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Norsemen are dedicated the same amount of page space despite a greater archaeological legacy, and he avoids the ""superficial"" and ""tiring"" ""doing of celebrities"" - the big names who won big battles in favour of the real important changes to societies and lives in the long run. Here I felt the writing of a true historian with a long view of history, a welcome alternative from the history of 'great men' that while fun, maybe takes up too much space on book shelves an in my mind. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>",,,1,0

I see now the film was a fine adaption, keeping the chaotic darkness though removing some of the complexity. Of course this means cutting some sections and changing some important details, but it made for a better film. The final third of the book is quite tumultuous (as the situation clearly was) but in a film it would have been a messy side adventure without the big emotional close the book does not have (or need).<br/><br/>The book full of wonderful language and has a great perspective, the innocence of the narrator slowly slipping away as his situation descends into mayhem in wartime Shanghai. One line about the violent 'tango' lesson his mother seems to have had that he sees in the dust of her bedroom hits hard. Later his furious will to adapt and survive while alone shines through. It brings moments of levity too, as when as a now horny 14 year old with a thing for his married woman cabin mate. <br/><br/>There are deeper explorations of identity of nationality - Jim is full of admiration for the brave Japanese, at times thinking of joining their air force, but he is also enchanted by the fast talking and quick thinking Americans - especially Basie, the relationship with him is far better explained in the book. It is only his Britishness he has a hard time accepting, having never been there and having few positive examples in terms of survival or energy outside of the Doctor. ",,,1,0

Smart and what I'd expect from a top historian, though I would suggest sections of the book fall back into this comfortable trap. <br/><br/>The background section on the Achaemenid  Persians was outstanding. Inspired by both Dan Carlin and Goodreads recommendation (thanks Noah!) It was this view into a lost world of clashing peoples, ideas, and religions that I enjoyed the most. There are wonderful descriptions of both sweeping ideas and technology such as the road and travel system, and marvelously gruesome tidbits such as how Cambyses had his army nail cats to their shields to shock the pious Egyptians. <br/><br/>The sections on the Greeks, particularly the Athenians, is not as fun! A long list of aristocratic families repeatedly stabbing each other in the back. Though I did like learning how the right to cruise for prostitutes became a cornerstone of their democracy.<br/><br/>The Spartan section is illumating, and of course not shy of gruesome tidbits themselves - the institutionalised sexual abuse of minors for one! Not a place you would want to grow up in.<br/><br/>The main sections and battles are expertly sketched out (and coloured in) with the authors analytical eye never too far away. Exciting and informative. <br/><br/>The postscript is also enlightening - it really hit me just how corrupt and vicious the democratic (and wider Greek system) was, slipping rapidly into yet more backstabbing, empire building, and soon enough a shedding of the very ideals the luminaries of the 'west' spend so long shining a light upon. <br/><br/>The Persians were fine of course after this bloody nose on the outskirts of Empire...never to hear from the rowdy people's from across the Hellespont again.",,,1,0

Then two new ideas are thrown in that propel the story through, an issue with alien communication and the Wallfacer plan to beat their spoken or recorded information omniscience. <br/><br/>This takes us to some mind bending places, though not before some quite weird and mundane love story sections.

While ""The Road"" has an unrelenting visceral horror, ""No Country for Old Men"" has a pulsating crime story, and ""Blood Meridian"" has unbounded violence, this book has elements of each encased within a more 'normal' setting, paired with some quite beautiful prose, especially about the titular horses!<br/><br/>It's a little slow to start with, you may not have known it was McCarthy if not for the vivid imaginings of the American Southwest. Later it becomes unmistakably his, the pace increases and we have flashes of violence, paired with musings on history, politics, beauty, religion, and death - much of it through the razor sharp character of the Señorita. <br/><br/>This is all hinted at as parts of the story, at times hitting you almost like zen koans. <br/><br/>There is a scene when the protagonist is simply eating a meal at a diner when the owner casually throws away the line while looking at newlyweds ""it's good God keeps the truths of life from the young as they were starting out else they'd have no heart to start at all"" - ouch.<br/><br/>There is a slightly strange allegorical ending, big themes of justice and God.

Not that it affects the message. <br/><br/>I consider it the best was novel I have read. Harrowing and brilliant. Simple yet profound. <br/><br/>The very first sentence states that it is not a condemnation but a record, though how modern readers could not condem the reasons, leaders, and general society that led, pursued, and escalated the war is hard to fathom. Though would today's civilization do much better? Hopefully.<br/><br/>At heart a simple story of a young group of classmates cajoled and bullied into signing up, with only the poor and simple seeing it clearly as a disaster from the start. There are few dates or battle names, it is a lived experience from an ordinary soldier. There are brilliantly written terrifying episodes of both hand to hand combat and modern warfare. Combined with the dreary, petty, and often disgusting life of a soldier in this war (think rats, lice, mutilations). <br/><br/>What really makes the book stand out is the psychological incisiveness. Seeing and feeling what this war did to these young men, both on the battlefield and when returning home. <br/><br/>The visceral fear and confusion during a gas attack in a cemetery will live with me for a long time. The matter of fact acceptance of the random chance of death coupled with the emotional detachment developed and required to survive by the men is jarring. Stating they were unwilling to fight, but crazed by a fear of death, knowing that the only way to overcome this was through violence, not so much against the French but against ahnaliation. <br/><br/>The trips away from the front offer physical saftey but more emotional pain. A theme in numerous later works it is brilliantly put here, with insightful context as to the impact of time upon the consciousness of the men. If they were sent back home in 1916 they would have ""unleashed fury"" but by 1918 nothing, as they were totally ""devoid of hope"" and with no one able to understand them, older people had a life they can go back to, but the young had that foundational part of life taken away, replaced with nothing but the war - ""Superfluous to ourselves"". He dispises and envys they people at home. <br/><br/>The language is often darkly poetic ""the landscape of our youth consumed by fires of reality"" ""no man's land is outside us but inside us too"" ""How much misery in two little things you can cover with your thumb's"" (talking about his eyes viewing POW). And to boot there is also a quite remarkable poem to the earth at one point.<br/><br/>There are juxtapositions of both micro and macro reasoning and suffering. The desperate promises he attempts to make with the man he stabbs, with the musings on how pointless all things, thoughts, and words are if things like this (the war) are possible as he surveys the maimed hospital patients, extrapolating the scene over all nations. ""It ruined our entire generation, all nations"". <br/><br/>Easy to see why the book was immediately banned by the NAZI's, and how they could tap a pool of disjointed and damaged men to their cause. <br/><br/>There are moments of genuine levity and touching fragments of true friendship and camaraderie.

His humble and piercing view that the system of slavery subjected both slaver and enslaved to misery takes a leap of thought that I fear I could not have made if such terrors had been inflicted on me. <br/><br/>He is unafraid to call out the hypocrisy inherent in both the US Constitution and of American Christianity, not easy to do so at the time. Making incendiary yet valid comparisons between his time under the tyrannical monarchy of England where he was treated as an equal, and his third class at best treatment even in the free states of his republican and fair homeland. Similarly his criticism of the Christianity professed to be practiced by those whom then inflict such injustice stands out for one who comes across as a true believer, having had to fight repeatedly to be allowed that privilege too.<br/><br/>He splits the book into the sections of his life, first begins with his childhood and his slow realisation and horror that he is considered different, and that he is a slave. Then with the general yet shocking brutality and injustice of the various jobs of his slave life, leading up to his escape. The entire section is riveting. <br/><br/>Mr Douglass in another act of self acknowledgement favourably looks upon his own hardships when compared to either full time field slaves or even worse, those enslaved in the deep south. Not that any part of his enslavement should be downplayed, true wickedness inflicted on mind and body, systematically, to all around him and millions more. He combined superhuman drive to constantly improve himself and others with what lucky breaks he found to excel in the most arduous of circumstances.<br/><br/>We move onto his initial life as a Freeman, interesting though not as gripping. His move into the abolition movement again ignites the interest, especially with the coming of the war. <br/><br/>Following Lincoln's assassination again we wind down a little, and the original work ends. There is a touching section I must mention where he meets both the children and even his old master on his deathbed, quite wonderful. The version I read was an updated some years after the initial run, adding a decade or so of political machinations and a leisure trip to Europe. It adds very little to the overall work, and could be removed. There are many thanks and names that are wasted on people of later centuries like myself. <br/><br/>I would like to see a modern biography to see both the import and validity of those later, quite political years. As well as wider thoughts on his overall life, work, and influence. A true American titan.",,,1,0

Working in the right type of team helps too. <br/><br/>The book is s little US based and they are openly working with the US intelligence services, that may not be a good thing depending on your POV - there are deep discussions on the Iraq war intenigence failure.

But it builds in tension and we have a large and varied supporting crew, the prominent role given to southern Pacific 'savage' Queequeg standing out the most, especially for the time no doubt. He was my favourite character. (Apart from the whale who I was rooting for.)<br/><br/>Captian Ahab is the prototypical monomaniacal leader hell bent on a doomed course, though we learn little of the why. One seeming insightful passage near the end where he laments his 40 years at sea and young family at home gives us no answer to why he carries on. <br/><br/>Our narrator Ismael takes us through everything and everybody else. There are signs of a keen mind and hints of wide reading with philosophical ideas speakled throughout the dense whale talk. Good points on the murder of animals in general and how farming, hunting and even a touch of cannibalism is no different, ahead of its time here. Also correctly identifies whales as mammals. But is way off in thinking they can't go extinct. <br/><br/>The story, when allowed to flow, is interesting and has moments of high drama. But it is punchuated by constant cetacean minutiae.<br/><br/>How much whale talk do I mean? Well on whale phrenology we don't have a paragraph, or an extended footnote, but 4 chapters. That's just the head, we go through the entire animal. It's a large animal. Then the extinct ones. Lord, did they not have editors in the 1850s? An abridged version would lose almost nothing without the majority of these sections.<br/><br/>Even with this idealised version I am lost as to why this is considered one of (the?) great American novels. I recently read 'The Terror' by Dan Simmons, also a lengthy book set upon the seas in the same time period, full of detail and a great beast, I enjoyed that one far more.

It plays out well, we see how babies encounter and overcome serious conceptual hurdles, the problem of other minds, that the world exists outside of subjective experience, and not just that sounds are words but that words have meanings. Doing this by making observations, predictions, theory building, and crucially adjusting or reprogramming these based on new data via a positive feedback circuit.<br/><br/>We also have solid theory building, notably the idea that we evolved a drive that takes pleasure from explanations of the world, from working things out. Paired with the 'pain' of confusion. This giving us a long term evolutionary advantage. <br/><br/>I say science book but I must add there is plenty of excellent and well written philosophy here too, it is explained that one of the authors studied philosophy at Oxford before persuing developmental psychology, it shows. <br/><br/>The strongest sections (see the sections on language) seemed authored by Alison Gopnik. I see she also wrote 'the philosopher in the crib' not surprising and I'm sure also great! She writes well for the New Yorker too. <br/><br/>This is not a guide for raising children though it has helped me understand them more. Adding priceless depth to the little things each day. There are ingenious experiments that dispell common myths and break new ground. The sections on language even helped me with my French studies! The text is speckled with some astounding facts about babies brains! Truly fascinating.<br/><br/>The popular analogy of the brain as computer is used well here. In fact I was recommended this book by an AI researcher, the sections on AI remain prescient and well thought out even 20 years later. Brilliant to see both the progress (in some narrow fields) and the lack of it due to the hard issues babies solve so quickly! Interested to see the authors thoughts here now.<br/><br/>There are funny and touching anecdotes, plus an impassioned section on what matters in child development, though this also touches on the time the book is from - dating it to the Clinton administration. I'm sure new data and findings have pushed the field forwards greater heights, with some of it probably from the authors. Small but unavoidable issue.

Even the evil characters have very human origin stories, products of their situation not fully in control of them. <br/><br/>Yet most of the time we spend in England, and I would note the same criticisms are not leveled at British society, most of the characters are upper class, with only fleeting (though entertaining) forays into the working classes. <br/><br/>It is structured in three books, and I found them quite different.

Musashi's quest, 'the way of the sword'  becomes evermore philosophical, highlighting spiritual growth through personal struggle and strict ideals, and introducing us to other quintessential aspects of what we think of as Japanese culture - sculpture, ink painting, swordmaking, ceramics, and poetry. Many of these are introduced through famous historical figures. <br/><br/>Japanese philosophy permiates the book, most clearly with with Musashi's quest to become one with his sword, action, and surroundings - akin to the elimination of subject object distinction. This move towards oneness, involving the study, then removal of mental concepts overlayed by ourselves onto reality is wonderfully placed and paced into the text.   <br/><br/>I would offer criticism that this way or code is not questioned itself enough. True we are instructed that the way of the sword is not all about violence, rather that the philosophical aspects are more important, including gaining wisdom on how to rule and how to help society, yet this does not play out in the book outside of the main characters psyche. <br/><br/>Nor for a work from 1930s Japan does it offer clear criticism of the then prevelalent hyper nationalistic Bushido code that stemed from and hijacked core themes explored in the book. These glorified ideals helped wrought such misery and devestation for much of Asia, including ultimately Japan itself. It may be not the plcae for a historical fiction novel to do this, but i would argue it would be for literature of the time to do so. A careful reader may find the lessons, a casual one only the glory in Japanese martial culture.<br/><br/>The scope and immersion in a time is reminiscent of Tolstoy, as are the philosophical asides and day to day minucia. However, the tighter focus on a single character, along with the repetitive structure make is distinct. You can feel the original structure in parts, it was a serialised newspaper coloum, much like many of the great 19th century Russian works. Unlike them it is not as smooth read as a book, we face several similar cycles of starting anew, a fresh challenge, struggle and personal growth, large fight. I could see a modern editor cutting or blending some of those cycles to please more casual readers - it is very long at over 900 pages.<br/><br/>The story itelf builds and intensifies for those 900+ pages, only hitting a surprising turn late on. Most storylines are tied up (and together) nicely - even if some drift unexpectadly part way through. There are some spectacular battle scenes, and many funny moments, generally involving the famous Zen monk Takuan. There is a strange yet oddly touching section concerning a possible sexual assualt, and some of the language and actions concerning women, while undoubtedly accurate for the time could sit a little uneasy for some modern readers. <br/> <br/>Required reading for anyone interested in samurai era Japan. Though maybe not so for those that are not. ",,,1,0

The tech and weapons are fantastic too. Again not what you expect from the opening sections. The panning of army logic is unceasing. <br/><br/>By way of light criticism the general arc is kind of guessable (even if you won't be sure why), and for a reader today the years listed are a little jarring - humanity seem to be comfortable in outer space by the 1990s and our hero gets back from a lengthy trip before today. Maybe that just shows our lack of expected promise!<br/><br/>But all massively outweighed by the smart snappy writing, outrageous humor, and touching humanity of a true classic.",,,1,0

I had stopped the series and taken up other classics and big hits of the genre, Hyperion, the Culture series, the Forever War, Children of Time, the Three Body Problem. I loved then too and worried my initial enthusiasm was a little overblown, happy to report that i need not have been concerned. <br/><br/>A section of our core cast is back in action, with a few good new additions. They really serve to show the human side of love, loss, pain, absolution, and the emptiness of revenge. That said the 'bad guy' is one dimensional and comically evil, barely believable. And many of the big hitters are reduced to cameo performances as the political story arc is paused for this adventure.<br/><br/>As with the previous books we have a scientific theme that permeates the action, here it's evolution, it is both explained and used in an examplary way.<br/><br/>More so than all of the other books we are situated in one place for the duration, this both stalls the grander narrative, we don't get much movement there until the final chapters, but allows for a fuller exploration of another theme, life in a lawless frontier. ""Civilization is built on corpses, people like you come later"" said to Holden.<br/><br/>It's the wild west in space, with added mutant slugs!  I found it entertaining and typically thought provoking, but it is easy to see how you could be frustrated with the general lack of progression - a little like a 'bottle episode' of a TV series. <br/><br/>I'll be back for the next installment!",,,1,0

Dan Carlin's Hardcore History podcast is the finest work in the entire medium, 5* all the way, so I am comparing this to that, and it falls a little short. But if you have not experienced the podcast, this is a great introduction work - best enjoyed in audiobook form as Dan's inflection and skill as a performer really brings the strengths of the work through.<br/><br/>Those strengths are vivid portrayals of the human experience in extreme situations, the subject matter of this book loosely being the fall of civilizations, including our own. His position as a fan of history, not a historian, is both self deprecating and allows for a sweeping scope that raises more questions than answers - as alluded to in the introduction. His great skill is in breaking the follower out of our modern mindset and immersing us in a lost past. Even if that past was only decades ago. <br/><br/>Fans of the podcast will recognize the themes and some of the material immediately. In fact several chapters are explored in greater detail in existent podcasts. Others have more space here.<br/><br/>All are riveting and nothing is worth skipping over, little known facts abound, harrowing darkness pervades, the questions ""what would you do? How did they feel? What did they think?"" hit hard, repeatedly. <br/><br/>Well referenced, encouraging of further reading - on both history and of common assumptions, and very entertaining, I only wish it was longer!",,,1,0

There are some good aspects, it is eerily atmospheric, and very well written, a grown up fantasy work for sure. <br/><br/>The story is punctuated with interesting moral and philosophical points, a notable passage on crowds acting like a species sticks in the mind. There are some cool biotech weapons (literally), but in general the book is slow on world building, to the extent I still know little of the world by the end.<br/><br/>The intriguing setting, of a world that has had but somehow lost the power to travel to the stars before regressing (?) to a medieval like state feels underexplored. You remain very time bound despite the occasional dangle of further knowledge. Hampered by the single point of view format. <br/><br/>The structure too didn't sit right with me personally. A teasing dramatic opening (left pretty much untouched by the end), a fairly standard apprenticeship story leading to the the kernel of a quest, then some weird and confusing love based dramas. <br/><br/>We don't get very far on that journey.

The latter point especially is part if the reason of condemnation from those of a leftish flavour. I recall a lot of it in the blogosphere and newspapers around publication and the accompanying TV series. It is clear why he became associated with more rightwing perspectives, praising Milton Friedman effusively, though I see no political agenda, just historical reasoning - Keynes is also praised and commended consistently. He is balanced and informative on historical welfare state comparisons in particular (Japan, Germany, US, UK). <br/><br/>To be clear the actions of Pinochet are condemned. If the economic policy is defended. And Karl Marx is mentioned several times (I once read he was excluded in a Guardian piece). <br/><br/>Ferguson is a great writer, I particularly enjoyed the enjoyable and informative asides that tell a larger story - those of the Rothschild's and Jon Law (!) especially.<br/><br/>Fantastic explanations of both complex terms, and complex historical situations. A good example is how the racist 'red lining' of US mortgage districts helped lead to the sub-prime crisis via wild west money men, good intentions, derivatives CDOs and all the other fun opaque terms we know and love.<br/><br/>We are brought into modern times with fun and informative stories from the 80s and 90s hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds, a lovely juxtaposition of globalisation pre WW1 and today, also a good if dated section on China. This is the only dedicated section outside of a European and then Western narrative. And it's about them joining the world finance built. We are told the accounting and finance technologies existed elsewhere, why did history not develop the same way elsewhere? <br/><br/>The dating is unfortunate, forcing the writer to not comment much on the big financial story of our lives, requires another book -Adam Tooze and Martin Wolf are well regarded on the subject. Similarly points on US healthcare are outdated but remain laughably valid. <br/><br/>We end with something quite unexpected - a detailed analogy on financial markets and the theory of evolution.

The idea here is to explore in greater detail the current and future of the 'Silk Road' regions, networks, and framework. <br/><br/>The content and analysis here is excellent, though i found the structure and rationale not so. <br/><br/>The sections where history is again invoked are the strongest as you may imagine, and the writing is first rate throughout. The analysis of today and tomorrow is pertinent, again pushing the long term and global view so refreshing in the original work, juxtaposing it with the twitter-led quick news cycle state of current affairs. One currently dominated by buffoons and parochial matters in the West of course.   <br/><br/>Here we run into a few problems - this book is also dominated by the same issues, by constantly stating their overstated importance, it serves to reinforce them. There is simply too much of Trump, and his officials, most of whom have already left office. <br/><br/>This leads to the next issue, i feel this book will date quickly. The original will be brilliant in 20 years, no doubt, i am unsure if this will be of much import by 2020. Many times two sides of a coin are described, but without knowing what way it will land hurts the historical framing that is used. <br/><br/>The entire book could very easily be added as a closing section to the original work, i may be cynical in saying the publishers may have been looking for a way to cash in on an unexpected mainstream success. <br/><br/>I certainly still learnt a lot, and the push to see the world from a more global, non-western and historical perspective remains vital and valid.

So often did i need to get something straight in my mind, so often was i blown away, so often was i dazzled on topics far outside the scientific understanding of emotion.  <br/><br/>This is a book that sets itself a big target - to revolutionise the understanding of emotion. I feel it hits the bulls-eye. Not only that, we also have an illuminating view of how science, history, politics, and society work in real life. <br/><br/>We are presented with the classic view, one we would all recognise from our day to day lives, one in-built to our societies, espoused by our luminaries, and assumed to be a fact. Emotions are distinct things inside of us, and can be controlled through rationality. Turns out they are not. The evidence is abundant on this point. There turns out to be no solid evidence of a single emotion network or trigger, rather, we are told they are contingent on culture, emergent, and belonging to the same class of concepts as money or laws. intriguing. <br/><br/>Following the deconstruction of the classical view, we are introduced to the constructive view, the How Emotions are Made from the title. This can be tough going at first, with the author switching between cutesy lay terms to hard science in a flash. We go through the ideas of body budgets, affective reality, the creation an use of concepts, a entire model of the brain/consciousness, and social reality. Emotions become a wrapping to help us react to situations felt in the body and predicted by the brain. They are constructed by us based on how our bodies feel combined with concepts we have picked up from out cultures. It becomes clear that different cultures have different emotions, certainly finer grained ones. <br/><br/>She does not say that illusions are made up, they are socially real, just like money or laws, real as long as more than a single person know what it means. Complicated and smart. This is labelled a superpower of humanity - and is exactly the same point that Yuval Noah Harari makes when he writes of the unique human ability to create shared fictions. Even if it turns out to not be 100% correct this really feels like the right path. <br/><br/>There are brilliant asides throughout the book. From different grades of anger in alternate languages, entire new emotions in Philippine tribes, to the fact that Russian's see two blues in the rainbow. <br/><br/>The final few chapters are clearly flagged as more speculative - yet the quality of the work is enhanced. We follow the application of the theory in several fields. <br/><br/>This includes a section on how best to master our emotions according to current evidence. Some of it is simple, yet is both effective and fits the theory - sleep well, eat well, work out, yoga - keeping your body budget in line. Some of it is more incisive, building the ability to re-categorise feelings, changing anxiety to anticipation for example. The book is excellent here on the social construction of the self, reminding me of the Ego Trick by Julian Baggini, and many Buddhist texts. Highlights the importance of the body as root of feeling of self. <br/><br/>There are excellent sections on common medical ailments, (chronic pain, anxiety, depression, Autism, the US opiate disaster), and a enlightening section on animals and emotion - and all help build out the theory, far better than current understanding. Could really help people in distress if worked on more. <br/><br/>There is a fabulous (and funny) section responding to an expected criticism - that this is a left leaning 'bleeding-heart' view of reality, this is shut right down, yes many of the issues we face are 'society's' fault, poverty trapping sections of society on the lower rungs, but she insists on the ultimate responsibility of each individual to surround themselves with the tools and concepts to progress, you are the architect of your own reality, bound but not fixed to a social reality. It matters how you treat others. <br/><br/>First rate popular science writing, a compelling narrative, some useful tips for normal people, some amusing is US focused anecdotes. I can understand other scientists of emotion picking holes or decrying aspects not covered in the book, but i assume the labs and journals are the place for these discussions. The author talks often about 'my' theory, and i can't comment if that tag is fully justified, similarly i am unsure just how rigid the classical view that is knocked out of the park is. However, as a lay reader and taken at face value, here we are shown a problem in current understanding, assumptions are methodically taken to pieces, and in its place a tentative but evidence backed theory is built out. It has the insight to power a revolution in understanding. ",,,1,0

The full answers won't come until the final few, but I was completely on board by that point. <br/><br/>The sheer inventiveness, the the twisted darkness, the hilarious tangents, hard to believe people can come up with this stuff, hard to believe we let them walk around freely! <br/><br/>Set in a post apocalyptic future, the story harks back to earlier times in the main character's life, a time still in our near future, where global warming, inequality, extinction, and biotechnology are really running amok. <br/><br/>The initial difficulty with the structure and setting is paid off handsomely by the end, masterful storytelling. Though be warned to get there you will go through detailed accounts of modern international child abuse. A book set in the future but about now.

A chilling, action packed, and wonderfully structured story that displays the hallmarks of a modern master of literature. <br/><br/>Cormac McCarthy, so we know it's going to be brutal and dark right? Yeah it is, though not quite as brutal as Blood Meridian (and with easier to read prose) nor as unceasingly dark as The Road. <br/><br/>We have a violent interconnected crime caper set along the Texan-Mexican border in the early 80s. As a portent of things to come it has been bang on. But it is through the motivations and actions of the three main protagonists where this work is elevated to something else. Something great. <br/><br/>The structure also plays an active and philosophical role itself at several points. It is actively jarring in at least two parts, one an pivotal moment that happens 'off screen' and another seemingly random accident. These major incidents provide deeper context to the characters and help tease out the larger questions of good and evil, choice or fate.  <br/><br/>Anton Chigurh is a master killer, for a lesser writer a force of pure destruction and evil to be defeated, yet here we learn that while in some aspects that is true, his is driven by ironclad values and principles. He see the world clearly, and sees the weakness changes in circumstance cause in others - stating men overestimate themselves when large amounts of money are involved. He 'honorably' kills for his word. He is acting as a function of a deterministic world - events set in motion by causes outside of his - even their - control. Even the coin tosses, random events (brilliantly written), he forces a choice from them, sets a path in motion and follows the rules.<br/><br/>You don't have to do this - yes I do.  <br/><br/>Yet he also knows about art, and has a plan that extends past the story of the book, he is not simply the bad guy, he is the future, in that line of business at least.   <br/><br/>On the other side we have the Sheriff. Seemingly a caricature of the elder American stereotype, lamenting the youth of the day, seeing decline all around, what today we immediately see as right wing Fox news fodder. Again, a lesser writer would have left that there, but instead we get the nuance, the meta commentary on American values, myths, lies. <br/><br/>""I don't believe in what it is (America) anymore, and I failed to hold up to the values when I did (during the war).""<br/><br/>""This country has a lot to answer for, will kill you in a heartbeat yet people love it.""<br/><br/>The story won't play how the audience expects, but the Sherrif is not simply the good guy, or the hero. He is not driven by order, responsibility, or goodness (or not only them) but by hidden shame of actions many decades ago and a final recognition of who he is - a man of his time not from a idealised past. Maybe one that can't carry on as before.<br/><br/>""It's a life's work to see yourself for what you really are, even then you might be wrong.""<br/><br/>Some touching father son sections too, a theme also explored in The Road of course. <br/><br/>Through the Sherrif we also have some genuinely funny moments, one line around abortion and euthanasia stands out in particular. These are the light moments in the book! <br/><br/>Moss, on first meeting our hero/anti hero. The aforementioned structure will see to that though.   <br/><br/>A man stuck between good and evil, a man who has made choices and acted, for both positive and negitive reasons. Driven by chance and hope, yet a man who does overestimate his abilities in the face of a big prize. A man who writes off fresh starts, stating how you are always hinged on your past, can't escape it. He won't. His young wife will call money a false god, he says real money. Real trouble too. Lots of human tragedy surrounding his story wedged between the forces persuing and driving him. <br/><br/>I had seen the excellent film many years ago, to my recollection it is very faithful, omitting only several (important to the book) scenes and some dialogue. There are more answers and time for deeper reflection in the book - as always.",,,1,0

But it is mine! <br/><br/>I am towards the beginning of my exploration of sci-fi, having recently embarked on The Expanse, Hyperion, and Children of Time novels. This is firmly in their quadrant and just as good.<br/><br/>Set in the early stages of a large space war, we have excellent world building, in some ways more complex than the novels listed above as we have alien species with ideological/religious imperatives. From this the book becomes rich in philosophical musings, from the perspectives of a ultra advanced cosmopolitan human society enhanced by AI, an arogrant yet honor bound giant reptile species on jihad, and from those in between. <br/><br/>Good writing, especially the exciting end game, the mostly nuanced characters lead to genuinely tragic moments and unexpected endings. Also some really funny and gross sections. A quite brilliant and brutal card game is brought vividly to life. Some really inventive and cool future tech too. <br/><br/>Though it is not perfect, we of course stumble into some expected tropes, a crew of disparate pirates, some of whom are two dimensional, moments of is he really dead? Who's side is she on? <br/><br/>Minor spoilers follow - after the end of the story there is a short yet sweeping postscript. Sweeping as after a Tolstoyan reasoning and explanation of the origins of the war, we then have a total history of it, from thousands of years in the future. The stories of all remaining characters and tied up (eliminating them from follow up books?). Entire species and civilizations are wiped out in single sentances. Bold and surprising to say the least! I figured the series would follow the war but that seems done. Yet this struck me as hard as any part of the work, it felt like the famous Carl Sagan lines the Pale Blue Dot. Everything we think is important, vital, defining, is but a mote when compared to galactic size and time scales. Humbling. <br/><br/>Back for more of the Culture series for sure!",,,1,0

That thesis, taken from an original essay that later spawned a book, made to seem so out of touch by the events of September 11th, is no where near the level of this book.<br/><br/>The title promises a lot, and yet it delivers. The book functions as an entire course on pre history up to the French Revolution. I wish I had read it before my studies. <br/><br/>The central thesis here posits three planks for modern state formation - a strong and capable state, the rule of law, and state accountability to citizens - and guides us through historical instances of all three forming separately and independently without a modern state forming until sixteenth century England. To its self aware credit, it does this by not focusing on Europe at all (avoiding Whig history), with the main polities studied being China, India, the Muslim world, and only later Europe. The scope is breathtaking, the entire global is at least touched upon.<br/><br/>Clear and consice on the development of the state vs tribal distinction, just as importantly, on its non linear development. Clearly demonstrated with global examples displaying unique contexts.<br/><br/>The absolutely central (yet with differing results) role of war, religion, institutions, geography, economics, and sheer chance are highlighted expertly. Many shocking one off facts and stats! <br/><br/>A real strength of the book is evident here, it is great in dispelling popular theories with historical and contemporary evidence, such as the tradagy of the commons. It seems the tradagy only started in modern times and in what we consider developed societies. Also with insisting, against classical social contract thories, that there never was a  primordial, pre-social time. Humans were social from the get go, a biological basis for society and politics. Clearly seem in our ape cousins.<br/><br/>The work glides between polar opposite thinkers like Heyek and Marx with ease, dispelling errors and highlighting pertinent points - expanding them even - without pushing a political agenda of its own. <br/><br/>In many ways this is an update on his mentor Huntington, who stressed political development is separate from economic and social development, breaking classic modernization theory. It goes further, stressing the importance of ideas, stressing the historically contingent nature of development. <br/><br/>Scholarly and academic, the work would go well with the more free wheeling and expansive Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari.<br/> <br/>The book hints as to what comes next and why things change - the near miracle of sustained economic growth per capita creating new social groups after breaking out if the Mathusian trap. To be explored in the next volume that I've already ordered. Pleasantly surprised at this brilliant book.",,,1,0

Awesome. <br/><br/>I was not disappointed. Everything below is contained within a world dominated by climate change, and much of it is actually about the 2008 crash and the current (and interlinked) political, financial, and climatic systems.<br/><br/>We have a spiders web of narratives centered around the Met building and the people who reside there; a political strand, a police procedural, a financial angle, a treasure hunt, a mostly comic relief story of fame, you get the idea. The stories and characters coalesce well, and we also have a polemical narrator who periodically vents against the evils of finance capatlisim. That comment is unjust, most of the critiques in the book are well thought out and argued. <br/><br/>Early on the book seems poised to very much be about finance, though this shifts to wider themes later on, I'm sure it's enough to put many people off, the jargon is dense, real, and spot on - Mr Robinson clearly did his homework. Utterly believable and educational. Funny too! ""Finance, or even just life: It had to mean something. And meaning had no price. It could not be priced. It was some kind of alternative form of value."" Muses our yuppie trader. <br/><br/>The 'cloud star' (read today's youtubers) Amelia provides both comic relief, yet also some real moments of passion and tenderness. The episode with the polar bears is one of the most unexpected, funniest, and wild moments of any book. Yet it ends with a furious and pertinent argument against purity - much needed today. <br/><br/>The writing is excellent, the story zips along through 600 pages like one of the futuristic speed boats - never a dull moment. Hits on many of today's major global issues, and hits hard. <br/><br/>Outstanding use of epigraphs.<br/><br/>Why not 5* then? <br/><br/>This is a homage to New York, and as such would clearly mean more primarily to residents, less so visitors (like me), less so again people who have never been - a passage from 'the Citizen' narrator claiming otherwise not withstanding. <br/><br/>The story benefits from a couple of Deus Ex (literally) machina, leaving the ending not quite hitting with the punch the heavyweight world building and story built up too. <br/><br/>Clearly on the side of the people not capital, more left than right, traders and yuppie millionaires?

Brilliant conception and execution. <br/><br/>The fantasy and magic are both novel and have solid internal logic.

How in many ways it is radically different, and more of a tangled web. Due in part to horizontal gene transfer that can take place even between kingdoms of life. <br/><br/>The story of how we came to think of evolution, and trees, is carefully sketched out including many interesting biographical details of the key scientists. Wow watch out for the Russian pedophile!<br/><br/>Later we are introduced to the various teams and people that would revolutionise the field during the latter parts of the last century. Though it is here we encounter the main issue with the book. There is a huge focus on a single scientist - so much so that this reads like an actual biography of Carl Woese in many parts. I see no reason why he takes so much of the page space, important though his techniques and discoveries clearly were. <br/><br/>Later chapters consider some mind blowing current science. Explaining major portions of our genome come from, or via, viral or bacterial sources  - as well as some of their essential uses! Shorter sections explore what this may mean going forwards. <br/><br/>The writing is excellent, and aimed at people with some scientific understanding, but he is humorous when confronted with many of the crimes against natural language science commits and clear with simplified explanations. <br/><br/>A final point I would like to make, the constant references to Nobel prizes won or not won. Not only this authors fault, but they should not be viewed as the be all and end all of science (or writing). Unbelievably overstated prize in many people's minds. We should have better ones!",,,1,0

There writers are free to go wild with technology and future history. This book is set in the present, with deviations to the near past. For me this grounds the work and sci-fi elements in our world, and the writer does an amazing job of creating realistic yet at times fantastic technological and engineering feats. Pushing the very limits of what we think we know and may be able to achieve in the future as of today. <br/><br/>I think some readers may not relate to the misanthropic characters who play a central role, but I am completely onboard with the program!

Strong on the evolution of the group and sub groups. Clear and insightful writing on these topics. Great on the last day of the dinosaurs and what happened next too. Eye opening on birds.<br/><br/>However, the authors personal history hits the book hard. I don't mind his clear passion or the at times amusing stories. <br/><br/>But his hero worshiping starts as a mild distraction and grows into a roaring T-rex chomping into the text. Cringewothy. All his idols and friends are the most brilliant superstars to have ever graced the face of the earth, many with superhuman abilities and 'cool' side stories, like a band of X-Men Dino nerds with drinking problems (absinth apparently) <br/><br/>He calls a group of them the 'rat pack'. Consistently. And without irony.<br/><br/>I even feel it leads to a serious error or oversight. The work runs through a few Dino superstars as expected, with T-rex getting a chapter. He clearly wants to emulate one of his science hero's who wrote a pop book on dinosaurs an T-rex in particular. He is at pains to label him the king, enjoying his 'reign' as the largest purley mean eating dinosaur ever. But Google says different. And he does not mention these 'pretenders to the crown' if I may. Suspicious. <br/><br/>The author is more balanced and scientific on the controversy surrounding the last day of the dinosaurs, where I feel he is much closer to the truth and has little need to be. The evidence is with him.<br/><br/>Lost count of the number of times he tells us where he did his various degrees and what god-like superstar advised him.<br/><br/>Recommended 'The day the dinosaurs died' in the New Yorker for an even better story and better writing.",,,1,0

I was always going to like this book! <br/>So I'll start with minor quibbles that I think Mr Sagan would approve of. It's a book from the 90s, some of the science and history is of course dated to that time. In some aspects we are behind his optimistic curve, others ahead in surprising ways - the commercialisation of space exploration for example. <br/>However, the tempered sense of awe and hope that pervades his absolutely beautiful prose outshines these minor points. What an exquisite writer to add to everything else. The book will be worth reading in a hundred years for both content and form. <br/>Content ranges from excellent arguments that all children should study against the central place of humans in the universe, to how our species may expand out of the solar system. Thoughtful, realistic, illuminating, wonderous, funny, yet acerbic to human stupidity and shortsighted government spending! <br/>Contains the famous pale blue dot paragraph, I'm clearly not alone in judging it among the most beautiful and meaningful passages ever assembled.
